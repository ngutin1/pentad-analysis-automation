Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. As Attorney General of California, I took on the big wall street banks and held them accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud on 34 counts. Trump On the other hand, we are running a people-powered campaign. And we just had some breaking news. We just had the best 24 hours of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. And because we are a people-powered campaign, that is how you know we will be a people-first presidency. And, Wisconsin, this campaign is also about two different visions for our nation. One, where we are focused on the future. The other, focused on the past. We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. A future where no child has to grow up in poverty. A future where every worker has the freedom to join a union. Where every person has affordable healthcare, affordable childcare, and paid family leave. We believe in a future where every senior can retire with dignity. So all of this is to say, building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because here's the thing we all here, Wisconsin, know. When our middle class is strong, America is strong. But Donald Trump wants to take our country backward. He and his extreme project 2025 agenda will weaken the middle class. Like we know we got to take this seriously. Can you believe they put that thing in writing? Read it as 900 pages. But here's the thing, when you read it, you will see Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make working families foot the bill. They intend to end the Affordable Care Act. And take us back then to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. Remember what that was like? Children with asthma, women who survived breast cancer, grandparents with diabetes. America has tried these failed economic policies before. But we are not going back. We are not going back. And I'll tell you why we're not going back. Because ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. Generations of America's... generations. And we have to remember this. The shoulders on which we stand, generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now, Wisconsin, the baton is in our hands. We, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will make sure every American has the ability to cast their ballot and have it counted. We, who believe that every person in our nation who should have the freedom to live safe from the terror of gun violence, will finally pass red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban. And we, who believe in reproductive freedom, will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not let their government tell them what to do. And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms as President of the United States, I will sign it into law. So Wisconsin, ultimately in this election, we each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in? A country... And to your point, do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear, and hate? And here's the beauty of this moment. We each have the power to answer that question. The power is with the people. We each have the power to answer that question. And in the next 105 days, then we have work to do. We have doors to knock on, we have phone calls to make, we have voters to register, and we have an election to win. So Wisconsin, today I ask you, are you ready to get to work? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.",full,1188

2024-07-30,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Atlanta, Georgia",full,"The evening drives away. Thank you, thank you. thank you . Thank you everyone, thank you, thank you. Thank you all, thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Oh, it's good to be back in Georgia. Thank you everyone. Can we please hear for Tyler? I want to thank Tyler for that incredible introduction. I invited him and several other young entrepreneurs to come and visit with me at the White House. And we had a really very long and important conversation about the future of America. And Tyler, you represent the best of our future. Thank you. And please give it up for Quavo and Megan. So it is so good to see everyone. And let me also thank our incredible members of Congress who are with us this evening. Senator John Assoff, Senator Raphael Warnock, and Representative Nakeema Williams, and Senator George A. To Mayor Andre Dickens, thank you for welcoming me, to Atlanta, and thank you to the great Stacey Abrams. You are an extraordinary leadership. So Georgia, it is so good to be back. And I am very clear, the path to the White House runs right through this state. And you all helped us win in 2020, and we're going to do it again in 2024. So let's get right down. So I'm going to get into some business now. All right. So Georgia, as many of you know, before, and have a seat if you have a chair. As many of you know, before I was elected Vice President, and before I was elected a United States Senator, I was an elected Attorney General and an elected District Attorney. And before that, I was elected a Vice President and an elected District Attorney. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. So in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's tight. And I have been dealing with people like him my entire career. For example, as Attorney General of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that was scanning students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scanned students. As a prosecutor, I specialized in child sexual abuse cases and sexual abuse cases. Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. And as an Attorney General, I held the Big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud. 34 counts. So in this campaign, Lock it up, Lock it up, Lock it up, Lock it up, Lock it up. So in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of complaint. Any day of complaint. Any day of complaint. Including, for example, on the issue of immigration. So I was the Attorney General of a border state. In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them, in case after case, and I won. Donald Trump... Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk. Or as my friend Quavo would say, he does not walk it like he talks it. He is a doctor. So look, our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, DC, supported the bill. Even the border patrol endorsed it. It was all set to pass. But at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down. He tanked, tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election. Which goes to show, Donald Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself. And when I am president, I will work to actually solve the problem. So here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed, and I will sign it into law, and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like. But make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. Truly, this campaign is about two very different visions for our nation. One focused on the future, the other focused on the past. We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity to build a business, to own a home, to build intergenerational wealth, a future with affordable healthcare, affordable childcare, paid leave. And all of this is to say, building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because we here all know when our middle class is strong, America is strong. And to keep our middle class strong, families need relief from the high cost of living so that they have a chance, not just to get by, but to get ahead. And yes, it is true that by many indicators, our economy is the strongest in the world, but while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still too high. You know it and I know it. And when we win this election, here's what we're going to do about it. On day one, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs. We will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits. We will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases. And we will take on big pharma to cap prescription drug costs for all Americans. Our plan will lower costs and save many middle class families thousands of dollars a year. But Donald Trump has a different plan in mind. One that would raise prices on middle class families. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda. I take it you've seen it. Project 2025 is a plan to weaken the middle class. Be clear. And Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He intends to gut our investments in clean energy jobs. He intends to end the Affordable Care Act. He intends to take on the price gouging and bring down costs. To take us back to a time when insurance companies have the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You guys remember what that was? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes. And we are not going back. We're not going back. And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. Across our nation we are witnessing a full on assault on hard fought, hard won freedoms and rights. The freedom to vote. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. The freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history. And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. Ours is a fight for the future and for freedom. And I don't have to tell folks in Atlanta that generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands. And we are fighting for freedom. And we are fighting for freedom. And we are fighting for freedom. And we are fighting for freedom. And we are fighting for freedom. And we are fighting for freedom. And we are fighting for freedom. And we are fighting for freedom. And we are fighting for freedom. We who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the freedom to vote act and the John Lewis voting right to dance and act. We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban. We who believe in reproductive freedom will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans and when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms as President of the United States, I will sign it in too long. So November 5th is in 98 days. In 98 days and let's level set, friends, let's level set. We have a fight in front of us. We have a fight in front of us. And we are the underdogs in this race. We are. But you see, this is a people powered campaign. Ours is a people powered campaign. In fact, after I announced my candidacy, we saw the best week of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. And if you go to comleharris.com, you can help us build on that success. So the momentum in this race is shifting. And there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it. You may have noticed. So last week, you may have seen, he pulled out of the debate in September. He had previously agreed to. So, so, so here's the thing. Here's the funny thing about that. Here's the funny thing about that. So he won't debate. But he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me. And by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird? Well, Donald. I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage. Because as the same goes, if you've got something to say. Say it to my face. Say it to my face. Say it to my face. Say it to my face. Say it to my face. Say it to my face. Say it to my face. Say it to my face. Say it to my face. Say it to my face. Say it to my face. Say it to my face. Say it to my face. Say it to my face.

I stand here today not only representing the greater women of Sigma Gamma Rho, but women across this nation. Women who are fighting for equal pay in the workplace. Women who are fighting for the right to control the decisions for their bodies. Women who are fighting to leave this world a better place for the next generation. There is a woman who for decades has taught not only women's rights or fought for not only women's rights, but the rights of all people. She is an alumna of the Howard University. She is a member of the Divine Nine Family. She is embedded into the fabric of our culture. She is a change maker, a fearless leader, and a woman we can all be proud of. And now it is my distinct honor and my privilege to introduce the first woman to be elected as Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris. Good evening everyone. Good evening. Oh it is so good to be with all the leaders who are here. I want to thank the International President Rashida S. Liberty. I thank you for your friendship and your leadership and for the warm welcome this evening. Thank you so very much. And to the International Board of Directors, to the Council of Presidents of the National Panhellenic Council, and to Congresswoman Robin Kelly, it is my great honor to be with everyone this evening. And I could please have a seat. I thought everyone was standing. If you have a seat, please have a seat. Thank you all. And to all the members of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Incorporated. It is so good to be with you this evening and I say that as a proud member of the Divine Nine. And when I look out at everyone here, I see family. And you know, we all, we share a vision for the future of our nation. Ours is a vision of a future in which we realize the promise of America and aren't so many of us empirical evidence of the promise of America. A promise of freedom, opportunity, and justice. Not for some, but for all. Since 1922, the members of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Incorporated have helped realize that promise. Generation after generation, the members of this sorority have shown that greater service brings greater progress. I know. In the 1920s and 30s, you created college scholarships for young black women. In the 1960s and 70s, you launched a nationwide program to help folks get a job. In the 1990s, you formed a partnership with St. Jude to fight childhood cancer. And in 2020, you continued your leadership when during the height of a pandemic, you helped elect Joe Biden, President of the United States and me as the first woman vice president of the United States. And for all of those reasons, I'm here to thank you for your longstanding service to our nation and to declare in this moment that our nation needs your leadership once again. In this moment, we face a choice between two very different visions for our nation. One focused on the future. The other focused on the past. And we in this room are fighting for the future. A future with affordable healthcare, affordable childcare and paid leave. And we fight for a future with equal pay for women. Because we know when we lift up the economic status of women, we lift up the economic status of children, of families and all of society benefits. We hear work for a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead, to build a business, to own a home and to build intergenerational wealth. We hear, see a future where we bring down the cost of living for hardworking Americans, which is why we are fighting to band more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits. To take on corporate landlords and cap rent increases and take on big pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. All of this to say, we are working to build up, to build up, not tear it out, and to build up America's families and America's middle class. Because we know when our middle class is strong, America is strong. But as we work to move our nation forward, let us be clear, there are those who are trying to take us backward. You may have seen their agenda, they call it Project 2025. Right. And it is a 900 page agenda of extremism. Project 2025 would raise taxes on middle class families and cut taxes for billionaires, eliminate the department of education, and end programs like Head Start, which of course would take away preschool from hundreds of thousands of our children. All of this to build on what Donald Trump did in his first term. When he was president, he gave tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He tried to cut Social Security and Medicare every single year. And he and his allies have tried more than 60 times to end the Affordable Care Act. And to take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. Remember what that was? Denying children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes. And you know, America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back. We are not going back. We all here remember what those four years were like. And today we were given yet another reminder. This afternoon, Donald Trump spoke at the annual meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists. And it was the same old show. The divisiveness and the disrespect. And let me just say, the American people deserve better. The American people deserve better. The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth. A leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts. We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us. They are an essential source of our strength. So I say to Sigma Gamma Rose Sorority Incorporated, ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on attack on hard fought, hard won fundamental freedoms and rights. The freedom to vote. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. The freedom to learn and acknowledge America's true and full history. And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. A fight for almost fundamental freedoms. And to this room of leaders I say, bring it on. Bring it on, those who would dare to attack these fundamental freedoms. Because we here, we love our country. We love our country. And I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. So we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. We who believe that every person should be free from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban. And we who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman's right to choose because we know one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. Because we know faith and freedom can coexist. And understand when he was president Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court, the court of Thurgood and RBG because he intended for them to overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended they did. And now in the South, where the majority of black women live, every state except for Virginia has an abortion ban. Many with no exception even for rape and incest. And now he intends to pass a nationwide abortion ban to ban access to fundamental health care in every state. But I will not let that happen. I promise you when I am president of the United States and when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms I will sign it into law. So in this you're welcome. So in this moment our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot and so is our democracy. This month and it really bears just with all that's been happening to just to for a moment pause and think about it. This month the Supreme Court basically just told the former president who has been convicted of fraud that going forward he will be immune for activity we know he is prepared to engage in if he gets back into the White House. Recall Donald Trump has openly vowed if reelected to be a dictator on day one that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. That he will round up peaceful protesters and throw them out of our country. And even quote terminate the United States Constitution. So in conclusion I say to the incredible members of Sigma Gamma Rose Rorty Incorporated there is so much at stake in this moment election days and 97 days and in this moment once again our nation is counting on you to energize to organize and to mobilize to register folks to vote and get them to the polls because when we organize mountains move when we mobilize nations change and when we vote we make history. So let us continue to fight with faith with optimism and with hope and when we fight we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.",full,1753

2024-08-08,Event,"Harris spoke at United Auto Workers local 900 in Detroit, Michigan",full,"Oh All right you a W family you know it's it's great to be here at local 900 What will we say historic local 900 because this is ground zero for a stand-up strike 11 months ago I'm very proud on behalf the UAW region 1a all of our executive board and all of our membership to welcome Vice President Kamala Harris And Governor Tim walls To our house to labor's house And we thank them for choosing one of their first visits with workers to be in the house of the UAW You know I don't have to say this I think you already know this but what's at stake in this election? It's very simple Everything is at stake It's about a choice of whether we continue forward or whether we go backwards That's right You Know this is a which side are you on moment and the choice cannot be any clearer on one side We got the Harris Wallsteen Kamala Harris Kamala Harris is one of us Governor Tim walls is one of us You know they're working class people they have working class roots they know struggle They know what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck You think about this Vice President Harris talked yesterday about how she's had a first job at McDonald's Governor wall has been a school teacher. We've seen what this what this government what the Republican Party in particular Has done to education in our lifetimes You know that's the difference they've spent a career Serving serving other people and Fighting for other people and not forgetting where they come from On the other side We got the Trump Vance what I call the Trump Vance disaster We know who Donald Trump and JD Vance are Their words and their actions and their body of work tell the entire story and they tell everything we need to know They spent their lives serving themselves Representing the billionaire class and enriching themselves at the expense of the working class You know Donald Trump calls me stupid And you know why because he thinks auto workers are stupid But we're not stupid We don't fall for Trump's alternative facts or what we all call lies This isn't about opinions This election is not about party politics All we have to do is look at these candidates in their own words and actions That's all the facts we need And that paints a very clear picture of which side the candidates are on You look at Trump in the recession. He blamed auto workers for what was wrong with these companies And we all know damn good. Well, wasn't he auto workers to blame? It was banks that went out of control with a mortgage situation And That through our economy and chaos it was not the workers in 15 he talked about doing a rotation of our jobs out of the Midwest our good-paying jobs Somewhere else where they pay less money. So we'd be begging for our jobs back for less 2019 when he was president plans were closing GM was on strike for 40 days and Donald Trump was missing in action In the 2023 big three strike in our stand-up strike He was nowhere to be found except when he called one of his billionaire buddies went to a business a non-union business here in town and paid people $20,000 to hold up signs saying auto workers for Trump The man's a con man And now you look at the body work with vice president Harris and Tim Walls You know vice president Harris bet on the auto workers In the 2019 Strike at GM, you know who was on the picket line with striking workers Kamala Harris She stood shoulder to shoulder with our members She helped as vice president create auto jobs in United States of America to bring work back here those The Lord's Town assembly workers who were left behind by Donald Trump Kamala Harris was part of the solution They brought a battery plant to Lord's Town Ohio and those workers that were left behind in Lord's Town That were transferred all over the country now they're returning back home to Lord's Town because of her She worked with us to save a community in Belvedere, Illinois that was written off for dead You know in the 2023 big three stand-up strike, you know where governor Tim Walls was He was standing on the picket line with striking workers, too You got two people up here that are still on the picket line with striking UAW members, that's a place Donald Trump will never be Governor Walls is also a proud union member. He's a teacher You know Anyone can be your friend when the sun's shining and things are going great But you find out who your friends are when things get tough And you know when we took when we look at tough times when we've been in tough times We see who chose to stand with us and Who chose to sit on the sidelines and do nothing? You know, there's a quote from dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I love you know it says in the end We won't remember the words of our enemies But we will remember the silence of our friends and UAW family this is not a time to be silent This is not a time to sit back and hope for the best This is our generation's defining moment Everything is at stake Future generations are at stake here Whenever we needed help Kamala Harris and Tim Walls answered the call and they picked us side They chose to show up and they chose to stand up So now it's our turn to stand up to speak up and to show up for them You know in the UAW we move mountains in the last year and a half And I got to tell you when I got elected president a little over a year and a half ago We had 90 days 90 days to prepare for big three bargaining And we did and in 90 days we won We went to organize Volkswagen in the south a place people said we couldn't win In a hundred days we filed for an election and we won And as of today we've got 89 days We've got 89 days to ensure that we put Kamala Harris and Tim Walls in the White House We won and we're going to continue to win because we stand up together in solidarity There's a reason UAW begins with the word United Because that's the key to winning So UAW family are you ready to stand up for the Harris Walls ticket? Are you are you ready to speak up for the Harris Walls ticket? And are you ready to show up for the Harris Walls ticket I Know you are So UAW family it's time to go to work and it is my ultimate honor To introduce Governor Tim Walls Thank You mr. President the American worker has no greater friend than you and your members Thank you for what you do every single day And to the sisters and brothers here in this spot as a union member Thank you for the privilege this is holy ground for unions local 900 and to be here and know For any union member understands what this place stands for and what it means And so thank you for having me here and each and every one of you Thank you for the privilege of walking that picket line with you last year Thank you for allowing us to lift up our voices and in Minnesota the work that you did it didn't just benefit you a W workers it benefited all workers So I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket and couldn't be prouder to stand with UAW Think about this 89 wake-ups. I've been saying this 89 days we can do anything for 89 days Telling people sleep when you're dead. We got work to do right now right now 89 days to make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States I Look Think think about Think about this leader that's very simple she stands on the side of the American people in the American worker She's the one who took on the predators the fraudsters the transnational gangs And she's the one that stands up against the billionaires in the corporate greed that bring that bring to it. This is who it is and She has a long record of delivering for union union members and organized labor All right, everybody in this room knows and I keep saying this this is a bit of preaching to the choir But the choir needs to sing Right now the choir needs to sing We know we know that unions built the middle class the rest of America has to you know who doesn't believe that Donald Trump He sees the world entirely differently and it really starts with this when I look at community and neighbors and unions and the word that Sean said unity this guy doesn't know the first thing about unity or service He's too bitty serving himself Again and again and again you've seen it. He put himself above us. He weakened our country to strengthen his own hand He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division That says nothing about how he dealt with his president. We lived through it. We lived through it He froze in the face of COVID and our neighbors died because of it And by doing nothing about COVID he drove this economy into the ground And I want to be very clear about this because there's a lot of lies that happened when they're Violent crime was up when Donald Trump was president Without even counting his crimes it was still It was still So this is very simple You know it and it's gonna take a heck of a lot of hard work, but this election is a simple choice What direction and what's our country gonna look like what direction are we going in? You know what we've said it Donald Trump's gonna take it backwards. He's gonna we aren't going back. We're not going back Look and this thing of playing dumb why he sets on the planes with these billionaires and says he don't know anything about Project 2025 I just fly on the planes with them You know what it's gonna do One of the goals of that plane and simple and they know this this has been going on forever Get rid of labor unions and get rid of the voices that we bring they can do whatever the hell they want then If Trump's returns he's gonna learn something from the last time he didn't get the job done this time It will be far far worse and he will get the job done and make sure that we can't organize collectively to improve our lives That's what it's coming So whether he cuts the middle class makes it more difficult to own a home whether it appeals to affordable care act So you can't get health insurance are the things that you know they talk about Guttting social security and Medicare. You know what when you got a billion dollars you don't give a damn about your social security check But if you're like my mom and you depend on the social security check as your sole income, it's pretty damn important And I've been saying it and you've been hearing me say it They will ban abortion across this country no matter what Congress says Now look it damn right it is and I don't know why this is so simple or so difficult for these people to understand You know how things work really well in life and really well with your neighbors and really well in communities when you mind your own damn business things work Stay out of our business Stay out of our business He's not fighting for you. He doesn't know you he doesn't care about your family and his running mate is just as dangerous and backward as he is So look we know who they are the choir is ready to sing this campaign is about the future your future Vice president Harris sure knows that she grew up in a middle-class family She goes to work every day making sure families are on the front so that they can get ahead and they can get into the middle class She believes in something so simple and so beautiful and when we go to these rallies I say it to people drive they set in the sun they get there They stand next to their neighbor for one simple reason and just like the vice president says they believe in their hearts in the promise of America They believe it they believe it So sisters and brothers in the UAW how great is this going to be? Please join me in welcoming the next president Good afternoon good afternoon. Oh, it's good to be in the house of labor Thank y'all please have a seat please have a seat. Okay, so let me just say first of all can we hear it again for Tim Walls? Isn't he spectacular? You know, I have to tell people that have been asking well, what do you and Tim Walls have in common? I said well, you know a whole lot a whole lot You know, we grew up the same way We grew up in a community of people, you know, I mean he grew up in Nebraska Me Oakland, California Seemingly worlds apart But the same people raised us Good people hard-working people People who had pride in their hard work, you know people who had pride In knowing that we were a community of people who looked out for each other You know raised by a community of folks who understood that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down It's based on who you lift And you know, there's some perversion that's happened in our country in the last several years Where there's a suggestion that somehow strength is about making people feel small Making people feel alone But isn't that the very opposite of what we know unions know to be strength It's about the collective It's about understanding no one should ever be made to fight alone That we are all in this together You know, you know why I fought my entire career for unions and labor because I understand the concept and the noble Concept behind collective bargaining and here it is here it is Fairness Fairness It's about saying hey in a negotiation Don't we all believe the outcome should be fair? I mean who could disagree with that the outcome should be fair It should be fair But when you're talking about the individual and a big company and you're requiring that one individual To negotiate against a big company. How's that outcome gonna be fair? So collective bargaining is about saying let the collective come together around a common experience Which at its core is about dignity and the dignity of labor And then let the people come together To negotiate so you make the balance and Then the outcome will be fair And isn't that what we're talking about in this here election? We're saying we just want fairness we want dignity for all people We want to recognize the right all people have to freedom and liberty to make choices Especially those that are about heart and home and not have their government telling them what to do Our campaign is about saying we trust the people We see you the people we know the people you know one of the things I love about our country We are a nation of people who believe In those ideals that were foundational to what made us so special as a nation We believe in those ideals and The sisters and brothers of labor have always fought for those ideals Always fought for those ideals and we know we are a work in progress We haven't yet quite reached all of those ideals, but we will die trying because we love our country and we believe in who we are And that's what our campaign is about we love our country We believe in our country. We believe in each other We believe in the collective We're not falling for these folks who are trying to divide us trying to separate us Trying to pull us apart. That's not where the strength lies And there is that And So I say to all the members of uaw and Sean feign as the first who I talked to about this I am so deeply honored as a lifelong supporter of union labor For Tim and I to have the endorsement of uaw Because you walk your walk You walk your walk And what we know like we have talked about we got 89 days to get this done You know the one thing about all of us is we like hard work hard work is good work hard work is good work The thing that we like about hard work is we have fun doing hard work Because we know what we stand for and That's a big part of this campaign. You know when you know what you stand for you know what to fight for We know what we stand for and we stand for the people and we stand for the dignity of work and We stand for freedom We stand for justice we stand for equality And so we will fight for all of it and The bottom line about uaw is that I also know and I'll say to all the friends watching look even if you're not a member of a union You better thank unions So I'm here to say thank you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to the sisters and brothers of uaw for all you are and all we will do over these next 89 days Thank you",full,3079

He's a teacher You know Anyone can be your friend when the sun's shining and things are going great But you find out who your friends are when things get tough And you know when we took when we look at tough times when we've been in tough times We see who chose to stand with us and Who chose to sit on the sidelines and do nothing?

Martin Luther King, Jr. I love you know it says in the end We won't remember the words of our enemies But we will remember the silence of our friends and UAW family this is not a time to be silent This is not a time to sit back and hope for the best This is our generation's defining moment Everything is at stake Future generations are at stake here Whenever we needed help Kamala Harris and Tim Walls answered the call and they picked us side They chose to show up and they chose to stand up So now it's our turn to stand up to speak up and to show up for them You know in the UAW we move mountains in the last year and a half And I got to tell you when I got elected president a little over a year and a half ago We had 90 days 90 days to prepare for big three bargaining And we did and in 90 days we won We went to organize Volkswagen in the south a place people said we couldn't win In a hundred days we filed for an election and we won And as of today we've got 89 days We've got 89 days to ensure that we put Kamala Harris and Tim Walls in the White House We won and we're going to continue to win because we stand up together in solidarity There's a reason UAW begins with the word United Because that's the key to winning So UAW family are you ready to stand up for the Harris Walls ticket?

This is who it is and She has a long record of delivering for union union members and organized labor All right, everybody in this room knows and I keep saying this this is a bit of preaching to the choir But the choir needs to sing Right now the choir needs to sing We know we know that unions built the middle class the rest of America has to you know who doesn't believe that Donald Trump He sees the world entirely differently and it really starts with this when I look at community and neighbors and unions and the word that Sean said unity this guy doesn't know the first thing about unity or service He's too bitty serving himself Again and again and again you've seen it.

We lived through it He froze in the face of COVID and our neighbors died because of it And by doing nothing about COVID he drove this economy into the ground And I want to be very clear about this because there's a lot of lies that happened when they're Violent crime was up when Donald Trump was president Without even counting his crimes it was still It was still So this is very simple You know it and it's gonna take a heck of a lot of hard work, but this election is a simple choice What direction and what's our country gonna look like what direction are we going in? You know what we've said it Donald Trump's gonna take it backwards. He's gonna we aren't going back. We're not going back Look and this thing of playing dumb why he sets on the planes with these billionaires and says he don't know anything about Project 2025 I just fly on the planes with them You know what it's gonna do One of the goals of that plane and simple and they know this this has been going on forever Get rid of labor unions and get rid of the voices that we bring they can do whatever the hell they want then If Trump's returns he's gonna learn something from the last time he didn't get the job done this time It will be far far worse and he will get the job done and make sure that we can't organize collectively to improve our lives That's what it's coming So whether he cuts the middle class makes it more difficult to own a home whether it appeals to affordable care act So you can't get health insurance are the things that you know they talk about Guttting social security and Medicare.

Please join me in welcoming the next president Good afternoon good afternoon. Oh, it's good to be in the house of labor Thank y'all please have a seat please have a seat. Okay, so let me just say first of all can we hear it again for Tim Walls? Isn't he spectacular? You know, I have to tell people that have been asking well, what do you and Tim Walls have in common? I said well, you know a whole lot a whole lot You know, we grew up the same way We grew up in a community of people, you know, I mean he grew up in Nebraska Me Oakland, California Seemingly worlds apart But the same people raised us Good people hard-working people People who had pride in their hard work, you know people who had pride In knowing that we were a community of people who looked out for each other You know raised by a community of folks who understood that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down It's based on who you lift And you know, there's some perversion that's happened in our country in the last several years Where there's a suggestion that somehow strength is about making people feel small Making people feel alone But isn't that the very opposite of what we know unions know to be strength It's about the collective It's about understanding no one should ever be made to fight alone That we are all in this together You know, you know why I fought my entire career for unions and labor because I understand the concept and the noble Concept behind collective bargaining and here it is here it is Fairness Fairness It's about saying hey in a negotiation Don't we all believe the outcome should be fair? I mean who could disagree with that the outcome should be fair It should be fair But when you're talking about the individual and a big company and you're requiring that one individual To negotiate against a big company. How's that outcome gonna be fair? So collective bargaining is about saying let the collective come together around a common experience Which at its core is about dignity and the dignity of labor And then let the people come together To negotiate so you make the balance and Then the outcome will be fair And isn't that what we're talking about in this here election? We're saying we just want fairness we want dignity for all people We want to recognize the right all people have to freedom and liberty to make choices Especially those that are about heart and home and not have their government telling them what to do Our campaign is about saying we trust the people We see you the people we know the people you know one of the things I love about our country We are a nation of people who believe In those ideals that were foundational to what made us so special as a nation We believe in those ideals and The sisters and brothers of labor have always fought for those ideals Always fought for those ideals and we know we are a work in progress We haven't yet quite reached all of those ideals, but we will die trying because we love our country and we believe in who we are And that's what our campaign is about we love our country We believe in our country.",chunk_5,747

That's not where the strength lies And there is that And So I say to all the members of uaw and Sean feign as the first who I talked to about this I am so deeply honored as a lifelong supporter of union labor For Tim and I to have the endorsement of uaw Because you walk your walk You walk your walk And what we know like we have talked about we got 89 days to get this done You know the one thing about all of us is we like hard work hard work is good work hard work is good work The thing that we like about hard work is we have fun doing hard work Because we know what we stand for and That's a big part of this campaign. You know when you know what you stand for you know what to fight for We know what we stand for and we stand for the people and we stand for the dignity of work and We stand for freedom We stand for justice we stand for equality And so we will fight for all of it and The bottom line about uaw is that I also know and I'll say to all the friends watching look even if you're not a member of a union You better thank unions So I'm here to say thank you Thank you.

2024-08-09,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Glendale, Arizona (need clipping)",full,"But above all, the Creator has blessed us with the wisdom of our elders, our veterans. Yes, the women whose strength carries our communities, and our children that give us the vision for our future. As we gather here tonight, we acknowledge that there is strength in the collective, all of us together. When we come together with one voice, our strength is multiplied, our actions create a greater good. Tonight, here in Arizona, here on Autum Land, we are bound together in support of Vice President Harris and Governor Walls because together they represent a brighter future for Arizona, a brighter future for Indian Country, and a brighter future for our Country. Tonight, we honor the past, but we look toward the future because we aren't going back to a time when our women were not protected. We aren't going back to a time of divisiveness. We aren't going back to a time when each and every one of us could not participate in a fair and equal democracy. So let us all come together tonight on our Autum Lands to commit to our future, and let's bring Arizona home for Kamala Harris and Tim Walls, the next President and Vice President of these United States. Next, please give a warm welcome to your regional organizing director, Carolyn Bonhorn. Hey everybody! My name is Carolyn and I'm an organizer for the Arizona Democrats here in Phoenix. I became an organizer because I see this election as being central to my future and to my family's future. I met my wife here in Arizona in 2019. We got engaged in 2021 and we started planning our wedding in the spring of 2022. In a crucial twist of fate, we found our dream wedding venue the same day at the Supreme Court week in which Americans learned that Roe v. Wade would be overturned. While the looming overturn was devastating for many people, for many reasons, as a young gay couple, we were cognizant of the online chatter that a burgaphel, the decision that legalized same-sex marriage, could be next. To be safe, we ultimately decided to elope. Two years later, as we now enter the stage of our lives where we are discussing raising children, the efforts by some in the GOP to limit access to IVF and to stigmatize LGBTQ parents and families mean that we once again are making decisions about our lives, our futures, and our dreams against the backdrop of Republican extremism. The question for my wife and I may soon become, will it be safe for us to get pregnant here in Arizona? I know so very intimately the stakes of this election are personal, and if you're in this room, I know you do too. I became an organizer this cycle because I want Arizona to be and to stay a safe place for families. And that means supporting Democrats up and down the ballot, especially Vice President Harris and Governor Walls. Vice President Harris and Governor Walls will do everything in their power to fight for reproductive freedom and LGBTQ rights. Under Vice President Harris' leadership, the Biden-Harris administration signed the Respect for Marriage Act, protecting the right to love who we love. And Vice President Harris has spent her entire career protecting reproductive freedom. Today, we have gathered in action to fight for abortion access for our communities, to fight for protections for our families, and to elect a Harris Walls ticket. In Arizona, elections are won at the doors and on the phones. So as we have crucial conversations with our friends and neighbors, events like today's are the events that make the difference. This election will be extremely close, and we need each and every one of you to get involved and join us. And now please welcome the Mayor of Tempe, Corey Woods, the Mayor of the City of Mesa, John Giles, and the Mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego. Well, good afternoon, everyone. My name is Corey Woods, and I am proud to serve as the Mayor of Tempe, Arizona. It's an honor to stand up here alongside two other incredible Arizona mayors, representing the strong bipartisan support for Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walls, as well as Democrats up and down the ballot from communities across the entire Grand Canyon State. So I can tell you, as mayor, I care about who follows through, who actually shows up and gets things done. Under Donald Trump, I can tell you right now, American cities were ignored, ridiculed, and most of them were killed. And most importantly, let down. Infrastructure week was made into a joke. Now Vice President Harris, on the other hand, she's been to Arizona seven times since she was sworn in. Under her leadership, we're actually seeing a stronger economy driven by manufacturing and small business growth with a safer and more secure border and less crime. Now, since we're all family here, you all have heard about this project 2025, right? But we all know that it's going to be front and center on the ballot this coming November. And why? Because Donald Trump is on the ballot this coming November. And do not be fooled. This is his agenda, written by his close allies, for him to impose on our country. He's running for his own personal revenge and retribution. Now, meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris follows through on her word. And she continues to deliver on behalf of the people. Governor Tim Walters has spent his entire career doing the same. So we must make sure that this coming November, we show up for Democrats. And of course, we help elect the first black woman and Asian American to be President of the United States. So my good friend right here, Mayor John Giles. And he has been exceptionally clear with all of us about what's at risk if we don't collectively act. So let's hear directly from him. Why don't we? My friends, I now present to you the leader of the great city of Mesa, Mayor John Giles. Thank you. Thank you. I am the very proud mayor of Mesa, Arizona, but I... Thank you. But I have to say, I feel maybe a little out of place today. Partly because we're in beautiful Glendale. Okay, there's that. But as you may know, I'm a lifelong Republican. All right? Now, I have... Thank you for your warm response. I have to tell you that I do not recognize my party. It has been... The Republican Party has been taken over by extremists that are committed to forcing people in the center of the political spectrum out of the party. So I have something to say to those of us who are in the political middle. You don't owe a damn thing to that political party. In particular, you do not owe anything to a party that is out of touch and is hell-bent on taking our country backward. And by all means, you owe no displaced loyalty to a candidate that is morally and ethically bankrupt. So again, to all of us, I would say in the spirit of the great Senator John McCain, please... Please, please join me in putting country over party and stopping... And stopping Donald Trump and protecting the rule of law, protecting our Constitution, and protecting the democracy of this great country. That is why I'm standing with Vice President Harris and Governor Walls. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris is the capable, just, and fair leader our country deserves. Vice Walls is a veteran with a long record of community service and bipartisan leadership. Both of them are well prepared to tackle the issues that Arizonans care about, from protecting our individual freedoms to leading Congress to solve the issues at our border that former President Trump loves to exploit for his own political purposes. That is why we need to elect this ticket who will be the adults in the room. We need people who are committed to solving problems and to govern from the center. That's why I'm voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walls. And now it's again my honor to stand with many great Arizona mayors in supporting this ticket and to particularly support and welcome my friend, the mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego. I am so happy to be here with my fellow Arizona Democrats and some pretty incredible Republican Tijuana elect Vice President Harris. I gotta tell you, it may be a little warm outside, but based on the energy in this arena, I know it's Donald Trump who's feeling the heat. Poor Donald. He's melting under the pressure. And I get why Arizona is a battleground and Arizonans are battle tested. We turned our state blue four years ago and you better believe we're gonna do it again. That's because in Arizona we know what is at stake and we are not going back. We know what it means to have a Civil War era abortion ban. We know about fake electors. But we also know what it would mean to have four years of the Harris administration and then four more. We know the incredible things that have happened with the Biden-Harris administration. They've protected our water supplies. They've invested in infrastructure. They took on big pharma and they won. In Phoenix, it's met thousands of good-paying construction jobs and jobs and semiconductors. Just a few months ago, Vice President Harris and I met with an incredible woman from the Navajo Nation who is a member of our local iron workers union. Because of her union, she was able to learn a trade and because of the Biden-Harris Chips Act co-authored by our own Senator Kelly, she's been able to find a job that pays six figures, which is life changing for her and her family. She's earning the most she's ever earned in her life. It's so inspiring and we can have more of that. That's the future I want where every American can achieve the American dream, not just those who started at the top, where combat and climate change is a real and urgent priority. A future that is hopeful, joyful and treats every person with dignity and respect. That's the future we will have with the Harris-Walts administration. It's more than just the good vibes we are feeling today. It will be the most pro-worker, pro-family, pro-freedom administration in our history. I am so proud to support Vice President Harris and Governor Walts and I'm ready to work with all of you for the next 87 days to deliver Arizona and the White House. Thank you. And now please welcome United States Representative Greg Stanton. Thank you. Those mayors are awesome, aren't they? We love them. Give them a round of applause. Good afternoon, Battleground, Arizona. This crowd is fired up. It is so great to see so many people here ready to fight to win this November. Now I know that there are a lot of people here and watching at home who aren't registered Democrats. Maybe you're an independent. Maybe you're a John McCain Republican who is sick and tired of the election denialism and divisiveness. Maybe you didn't vote in the last election and you were here to check out what all the buzz is about. To each of you, I say welcome. We are glad that you are here and we are excited to earn your support. Now I have known Kamala Harris for nearly 20 years. Let me tell you something. Our Vice President, she is the real deal. She's tough. She's principled and she is battle tested. And her running mate, Coach Walls, he is a great guy and a long time teacher. Let's give it up for our teachers. We love our teachers. And Coach, he knows how to work across the aisle and get things done to improve people's lives. Look, the contrast in this race, it could not be clear. While Kamala Harris is fighting for American's fundamental rights, including a woman's right to make choices about her own body. Trump brags about overturning Roe v. Wade. While we are working to lift children out of poverty, grow our economy and create good paying jobs, Donald Trump's project 2025 agenda would get rid of the Affordable Care Act and give tax cuts to billionaires on the backs of the middle class. Kamala Harris is running on a vision for our future where everyone has the opportunity to get by, not just get by, but to get ahead. That's her vision. And she's going to need all of us and she's going to need a Congress that shares her vision. That's why we need to send Ruben Gallego to the United States Senate. I can't wait to see Ruben Gallego side by side with our Senator Mark Kelly, who's doing such a great job representing Arizona. Now I'm a house guy. And the path to retaking the majority in the House of Representatives, it runs right through Arizona. We've got great candidates here in Arizona. The brilliant Kirsten's angle in Southern Arizona, the former president of the Navajo Nation, Jonathan Nez in Northern Arizona, and my long time friend Dr. Amish Shah, who's going to win right here in Maricopa County. And when we win the majority in the House of Representatives, we will make history by electing Hakim Jeffries, Speaker of the House. We need to be honest. This presidential race is going to be really, really close here in Arizona. You're going to see a lot of polls. One day we're down, the next day we are up. Ignore the polls. Tune them out. There is one thing that will determine our success in November. That's the amount of work that we put in. Are we willing to roll up our sleeves and do the work to elect Vice President Harris and Coach Walls? This isn't our first rodeo. We worked so hard to elect Senator Mark Kelly to the U.S. Senate twice. And we elected the first Democratic governor in 15 years in this state, Katie Hobbs, just two years ago. And we delivered for Arizona when we elected President Joe Biden just four years ago in this state. Arizona is the most important battleground state in the entire country in this most important election. In Arizona, we have won tough battles before, and we're going to do it again this year.

Yes, the women whose strength carries our communities, and our children that give us the vision for our future. As we gather here tonight, we acknowledge that there is strength in the collective, all of us together. When we come together with one voice, our strength is multiplied, our actions create a greater good. Tonight, here in Arizona, here on Autum Land, we are bound together in support of Vice President Harris and Governor Walls because together they represent a brighter future for Arizona, a brighter future for Indian Country, and a brighter future for our Country. Tonight, we honor the past, but we look toward the future because we aren't going back to a time when our women were not protected. We aren't going back to a time of divisiveness. We aren't going back to a time when each and every one of us could not participate in a fair and equal democracy. So let us all come together tonight on our Autum Lands to commit to our future, and let's bring Arizona home for Kamala Harris and Tim Walls, the next President and Vice President of these United States. Next, please give a warm welcome to your regional organizing director, Carolyn Bonhorn. Hey everybody! My name is Carolyn and I'm an organizer for the Arizona Democrats here in Phoenix. I became an organizer because I see this election as being central to my future and to my family's future. I met my wife here in Arizona in 2019. We got engaged in 2021 and we started planning our wedding in the spring of 2022. In a crucial twist of fate, we found our dream wedding venue the same day at the Supreme Court week in which Americans learned that Roe v. Wade would be overturned. While the looming overturn was devastating for many people, for many reasons, as a young gay couple, we were cognizant of the online chatter that a burgaphel, the decision that legalized same-sex marriage, could be next. To be safe, we ultimately decided to elope. Two years later, as we now enter the stage of our lives where we are discussing raising children, the efforts by some in the GOP to limit access to IVF and to stigmatize LGBTQ parents and families mean that we once again are making decisions about our lives, our futures, and our dreams against the backdrop of Republican extremism.",chunk_1,416
2024-08-09,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Glendale, Arizona (need clipping)",chunk,"The question for my wife and I may soon become, will it be safe for us to get pregnant here in Arizona? I know so very intimately the stakes of this election are personal, and if you're in this room, I know you do too. I became an organizer this cycle because I want Arizona to be and to stay a safe place for families. And that means supporting Democrats up and down the ballot, especially Vice President Harris and Governor Walls. Vice President Harris and Governor Walls will do everything in their power to fight for reproductive freedom and LGBTQ rights. Under Vice President Harris' leadership, the Biden-Harris administration signed the Respect for Marriage Act, protecting the right to love who we love. And Vice President Harris has spent her entire career protecting reproductive freedom. Today, we have gathered in action to fight for abortion access for our communities, to fight for protections for our families, and to elect a Harris Walls ticket. In Arizona, elections are won at the doors and on the phones. So as we have crucial conversations with our friends and neighbors, events like today's are the events that make the difference. This election will be extremely close, and we need each and every one of you to get involved and join us. And now please welcome the Mayor of Tempe, Corey Woods, the Mayor of the City of Mesa, John Giles, and the Mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego. Well, good afternoon, everyone. My name is Corey Woods, and I am proud to serve as the Mayor of Tempe, Arizona. It's an honor to stand up here alongside two other incredible Arizona mayors, representing the strong bipartisan support for Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walls, as well as Democrats up and down the ballot from communities across the entire Grand Canyon State. So I can tell you, as mayor, I care about who follows through, who actually shows up and gets things done. Under Donald Trump, I can tell you right now, American cities were ignored, ridiculed, and most of them were killed. And most importantly, let down.",chunk_2,355
2024-08-09,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Glendale, Arizona (need clipping)",chunk,"Infrastructure week was made into a joke. Now Vice President Harris, on the other hand, she's been to Arizona seven times since she was sworn in. Under her leadership, we're actually seeing a stronger economy driven by manufacturing and small business growth with a safer and more secure border and less crime. Now, since we're all family here, you all have heard about this project 2025, right? But we all know that it's going to be front and center on the ballot this coming November. And why? Because Donald Trump is on the ballot this coming November. And do not be fooled. This is his agenda, written by his close allies, for him to impose on our country. He's running for his own personal revenge and retribution. Now, meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris follows through on her word. And she continues to deliver on behalf of the people. Governor Tim Walters has spent his entire career doing the same. So we must make sure that this coming November, we show up for Democrats. And of course, we help elect the first black woman and Asian American to be President of the United States. So my good friend right here, Mayor John Giles. And he has been exceptionally clear with all of us about what's at risk if we don't collectively act. So let's hear directly from him. Why don't we? My friends, I now present to you the leader of the great city of Mesa, Mayor John Giles. Thank you. Thank you. I am the very proud mayor of Mesa, Arizona, but I.. Thank you. But I have to say, I feel maybe a little out of place today. Partly because we're in beautiful Glendale. Okay, there's that. But as you may know, I'm a lifelong Republican. All right? Now, I have.. Thank you for your warm response. I have to tell you that I do not recognize my party. It has been.. The Republican Party has been taken over by extremists that are committed to forcing people in the center of the political spectrum out of the party. So I have something to say to those of us who are in the political middle. You don't owe a damn thing to that political party.",chunk_3,375
2024-08-09,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Glendale, Arizona (need clipping)",chunk,"In particular, you do not owe anything to a party that is out of touch and is hell-bent on taking our country backward. And by all means, you owe no displaced loyalty to a candidate that is morally and ethically bankrupt. So again, to all of us, I would say in the spirit of the great Senator John McCain, please.. Please, please join me in putting country over party and stopping.. And stopping Donald Trump and protecting the rule of law, protecting our Constitution, and protecting the democracy of this great country. That is why I'm standing with Vice President Harris and Governor Walls. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris is the capable, just, and fair leader our country deserves. Vice Walls is a veteran with a long record of community service and bipartisan leadership. Both of them are well prepared to tackle the issues that Arizonans care about, from protecting our individual freedoms to leading Congress to solve the issues at our border that former President Trump loves to exploit for his own political purposes. That is why we need to elect this ticket who will be the adults in the room. We need people who are committed to solving problems and to govern from the center. That's why I'm voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walls. And now it's again my honor to stand with many great Arizona mayors in supporting this ticket and to particularly support and welcome my friend, the mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego. I am so happy to be here with my fellow Arizona Democrats and some pretty incredible Republican Tijuana elect Vice President Harris. I gotta tell you, it may be a little warm outside, but based on the energy in this arena, I know it's Donald Trump who's feeling the heat. Poor Donald. He's melting under the pressure. And I get why Arizona is a battleground and Arizonans are battle tested. We turned our state blue four years ago and you better believe we're gonna do it again. That's because in Arizona we know what is at stake and we are not going back. We know what it means to have a Civil War era abortion ban.",chunk_4,363
2024-08-09,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Glendale, Arizona (need clipping)",chunk,"We know about fake electors. But we also know what it would mean to have four years of the Harris administration and then four more. We know the incredible things that have happened with the Biden-Harris administration. They've protected our water supplies. They've invested in infrastructure. They took on big pharma and they won. In Phoenix, it's met thousands of good-paying construction jobs and jobs and semiconductors. Just a few months ago, Vice President Harris and I met with an incredible woman from the Navajo Nation who is a member of our local iron workers union. Because of her union, she was able to learn a trade and because of the Biden-Harris Chips Act co-authored by our own Senator Kelly, she's been able to find a job that pays six figures, which is life changing for her and her family. She's earning the most she's ever earned in her life. It's so inspiring and we can have more of that. That's the future I want where every American can achieve the American dream, not just those who started at the top, where combat and climate change is a real and urgent priority. A future that is hopeful, joyful and treats every person with dignity and respect. That's the future we will have with the Harris-Walts administration. It's more than just the good vibes we are feeling today. It will be the most pro-worker, pro-family, pro-freedom administration in our history. I am so proud to support Vice President Harris and Governor Walts and I'm ready to work with all of you for the next 87 days to deliver Arizona and the White House. Thank you. And now please welcome United States Representative Greg Stanton. Thank you. Those mayors are awesome, aren't they? We love them. Give them a round of applause. Good afternoon, Battleground, Arizona. This crowd is fired up. It is so great to see so many people here ready to fight to win this November. Now I know that there are a lot of people here and watching at home who aren't registered Democrats. Maybe you're an independent. Maybe you're a John McCain Republican who is sick and tired of the election denialism and divisiveness.",chunk_5,366

To each of you, I say welcome. We are glad that you are here and we are excited to earn your support. Now I have known Kamala Harris for nearly 20 years. Let me tell you something. Our Vice President, she is the real deal. She's tough. She's principled and she is battle tested. And her running mate, Coach Walls, he is a great guy and a long time teacher. Let's give it up for our teachers. We love our teachers. And Coach, he knows how to work across the aisle and get things done to improve people's lives. Look, the contrast in this race, it could not be clear. While Kamala Harris is fighting for American's fundamental rights, including a woman's right to make choices about her own body. Trump brags about overturning Roe v. Wade. While we are working to lift children out of poverty, grow our economy and create good paying jobs, Donald Trump's project 2025 agenda would get rid of the Affordable Care Act and give tax cuts to billionaires on the backs of the middle class. Kamala Harris is running on a vision for our future where everyone has the opportunity to get by, not just get by, but to get ahead. That's her vision. And she's going to need all of us and she's going to need a Congress that shares her vision. That's why we need to send Ruben Gallego to the United States Senate. I can't wait to see Ruben Gallego side by side with our Senator Mark Kelly, who's doing such a great job representing Arizona. Now I'm a house guy. And the path to retaking the majority in the House of Representatives, it runs right through Arizona. We've got great candidates here in Arizona. The brilliant Kirsten's angle in Southern Arizona, the former president of the Navajo Nation, Jonathan Nez in Northern Arizona, and my long time friend Dr. Amish Shah, who's going to win right here in Maricopa County. And when we win the majority in the House of Representatives, we will make history by electing Hakim Jeffries, Speaker of the House.",chunk_6,374
2024-08-09,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Glendale, Arizona (need clipping)",chunk,"We need to be honest. This presidential race is going to be really, really close here in Arizona. You're going to see a lot of polls. One day we're down, the next day we are up. Ignore the polls. Tune them out. There is one thing that will determine our success in November. That's the amount of work that we put in. Are we willing to roll up our sleeves and do the work to elect Vice President Harris and Coach Walls? This isn't our first rodeo. We worked so hard to elect Senator Mark Kelly to the U.S. Senate twice. And we elected the first Democratic governor in 15 years in this state, Katie Hobbs, just two years ago. And we delivered for Arizona when we elected President Joe Biden just four years ago in this state. Arizona is the most important battleground state in the entire country in this most important election. In Arizona, we have won tough battles before, and we're going to do it again this year.

2024-08-10,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada",full,"Can we hear for Tim Wolves? Oh, it's so good to be back. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening. Oh, I see lots of friends. Oh, it is good to be back. It is good to be back. Thank you, guys. Thank you, everyone. But seriously, isn't Tim Wolves fantastic? Yes! And I know for some folks, you just get to know him, and you've heard he's had many titles over his life, Governor, Congressman, Dad, Husband, Coach. But in 87 days, our nation is going to know Coach Wolves as Vice President of the United States of America. That's right. And it is so good to be here with so many incredible leaders, including my dear friends, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. Senator Jackie Rosen, who we will re-elect to the United States Senate. Congress members, Dina Titus, Stephen Horsford, and Susie Lee. And I know Culinary 226 is in the house. And I will tell you. And the Culinary Union, as everyone in Nevada knows, they have helped lead the way in our country for workers' rights and workers' dignity. And I have to say, for years, I've been so proud to work by your side. When I was Attorney General of California, we worked together to crack down on wage theft. When I was a United States Senator, we fought together for paid family leave and medical leave. And earlier this year, right here in Vegas, we celebrated your historic contract win. And it is my promise to everyone here, when I am President, we will continue our fight for working families of America. Including to raise the minimum wage and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers. And Nevada today, I also bring greetings from our incredible President Joe Biden. We love Joe. It's great. And I know, I'm going to tell them what you all just said. And I know we are all so deeply grateful to Joe Biden for his lifetime of service to our nation. And he's not done. So as I said, it's so good to be back in Las Vegas. The last time I was here, I stopped by the practice for the men's national basketball team before they headed out to the Olympics. And maybe you saw it on your phone, they looked a few hours ago in Paris, they won the gold. And I got more for you, a few hours before that. The women's national soccer team won the gold as well. So in one sport after another, Team USA continues to make our nation proud. So much to celebrate, so much to celebrate. So Nevada, we have 87 days until the election. 87 days. And here's the thing. But here's the thing, here's the thing. We know this will be a tight race until the very end. And so let's not pay too much attention to the polls because we have some hard work ahead of us. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. And with your help this November, we will win. We will win. We will win. And I know we are all clear toward that win. We are all clear about what we are up against. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected a United States Senator, I was an elected attorney general and before that district attorney. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. So Nevada, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's tight. Well, well, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. The court's going to take care of that. We'll beat him in November. We'll beat him in November. But I've certainly been dealing with people like him my entire career. For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. Remember that? As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. As attorney general, I held Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud, 34 counts. All of this is to say, in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his every day of the week. That being said, let's make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It is about two different visions for our nation. One, ours, focused on the future. The other, focused on the past. We're not going back. And we're not going back because Nevada, we fight for the future. We fight for a future with affordable healthcare, affordable childcare, and paid leave. We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth. We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families so they have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead. Because look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. When I was Attorney General, I went after price-fixing schemes, and when I am President, I will continue that work to bring down prices. I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price-gouging, corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families, and take on big pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. Unlike Donald Trump, I will always, I promise you, put the middle class and working families first. Because you see, Tim Walz and I may not appear to have a whole lot in common, but we have so much in common. And I'll tell you what he and I know, the middle class built the United States of America. And when the middle class is strong, America is strong. And so while we together work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump has a different plan. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda. Which I keep saying, I can't believe they put that in writing. And so if he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. And he intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis. And I don't need to tell Nevada every day because you feel the impact of extreme heat and drought. You know the climate crisis is real. But Donald Trump, well, he claims it's a hoax. And on top of this, if Donald Trump were to win in November, he won't. But if he were to win in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. Think about that. To take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was like? Children with asthma? Breast cancer survivors? Grandparents with diabetes? Look, America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. And we are going to move forward. We will move forward. And in moving forward, we will take on the biggest issues facing our nation. For example, we will address the issue of immigration. I was the attorney general of a border state. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers who came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won. We know our immigration system is broken, and we know what it takes to fix it. Comprehensive reform that includes yes, strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship. But Donald Trump doesn't want to fix this problem. He talks a big game about a lot of things. But he talks a big game about border security, but he does not walk the walk. Earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades. But Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought it would help him win an election. Well, when I am president, I will sign that bill into law. Nevada Hours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. Across our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault on hard-won, hard-fought freedoms and fundamental rights. The freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. A fight for freedom. And on that last point, we all know how we got here. When he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court. Because he intended for them to undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. Now, in more than 20 states, there is a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. And be sure, if he were to win, he would sign a national abortion ban. Which would outlaw abortion in every state, even Nevada. But we are not going to let that happen. Because we trust women. And when I am president of the United States and Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, I will sign it into law. So I know the folks who are here. I know the people of Nevada. You are battle-born. You are battle-born. And if Donald Trump wants to pick a fight over our most fundamental freedoms, we say, bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. We are ready. So, Nevada, generations, generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now, the baton is in our hands. Each and every one of us. So we, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. And we, who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence, will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and red flag laws. So much is on the line. So much is on the line in this election. And understand, this is not 2016. This is not 2020. This time around, the stakes are even higher. And that's because, last month, the Supreme Court of the United States basically told the former president that going forward, he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. But think about what that means. Think about what that means. So, Donald Trump has vowed to be a dictator on day one of re-elected. He said he will weaponize essentially the Department of Justice against his political enemies. And even called for the, quote, termination of the Constitution of the United States. Let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal. The seal of President of the United States. Never again. That's right. That's right. That's right. We know what we stand for as Americans. And you know, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we preserve the promise of America. And think about it. After all, the promise of America is what makes it possible for Tim Walls and me to be together on this stage today. Think about that. Think about that. Think about it. Two middle class kids. One daughter of Oakland, California. The other who was raised by a working mother. I had a summer job at McDonald's. The other, a son of the Nebraska Plains who grew up working on a farm. Think about it. Think about it. Only in America is it possible that the two of them would be running together all the way to the White House. Only in America. Only in America. So look, and I love you back. I love you back. So look, we are together. We are running this campaign on behalf of all Americans. From red states to blue states. From the heartland to the coast. And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. All Americans. So Nevada, ultimately in this election, I believe we each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in? A country of chaos, fear and hate? Or a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law? And the beauty of our democracy, here's the thing. The beauty of our democracy is we each person has the power to answer that question. The power is with the people. The power is with the people. It's with the people. And so in the next 87 days, we need you to use your power. To knock on doors, register folks to vote and make your voices heard. So Nevada, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you, God bless the United States of America. .",full,2296

2024-08-15,Event,"Harris delivered remarks in Largo, Maryland",full,"Good afternoon everybody. My name is Judy Akin. I'm a 70 year old retired registered nurse from Portland, Maine. Where I live with my husband of 47 years, our two beagles and our son and granddaughter live nearby. Also for over four decades I've battled psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. That's taken a heavy toll on my body. But nothing could prepare me for the financial strain that came with the high cost of the drugs I need to live my life. Including enbrel which comes with a staggering list price. Last year alone I spent over $9,000 out of pocket just to afford this one drug. As a nurse I counseled patients on the importance of taking their medications consistently. But I have to admit that sometimes I found myself unable to follow my own advice and have been known to skip a dose here and there. For years it felt like no one was standing up to big pharma for patients like me. But thanks to President Biden and Vice President Harris's Inflation Reduction Act, that is changing. Now, enbrel is one of the first ten drugs up for Medicare negotiation. The thought of a lower list price for this essential medication feels like a lifeline. President Biden didn't just make a promise, he kept it. Because of the Biden-Harris administration's actions, my husband and I can finally breathe a little easier. That's why it is my great honor to introduce the team who leads the fight to put patients above profits. The President of the United States, Joe Biden and Vice President Pamela Harris. I'm just gonna shut down the shut deal and sweep the door. When the hook, the catapults stay in the room. When the run, here in the evil room. We take care of that room. We take care of that room. Where every slice of time. Good afternoon. Good afternoon everyone. Can we please applaud Judy? I love you guys. It's good to see so many friends. It is good to see so many friends. And I want to thank you. Thank you. And let's please thank you. I love you back. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I know we all thank Judy for sharing her story. I think we all know it takes a very special person who has dedicated over 40 years of their life to do the work that Judy has done as a nurse. That work being what? To care about other people in a way that is about lifting them up and caring about their well-being. So Judy, we thank you so very much for being here today. I want to recognize the incredible Governor Wes Moore. Who's here with Don and his son. And Wes, I am so thankful to you for all that you do in service to our nation in so many different ways. And your friendship. But in particular, to share such a personal story as you have. And I know it takes a lot out of you to share that story. But to do it in a way that is about lifting up other people and helping hopefully others who are not in this room, understanding how real people are impacted every day about this issue and by this issue. Thank you. I want to recognize the people of our administration, including Secretary Becerra, who is here. The bold administrator of Brooks LaSour, who is here. My dear friend and former colleague, Senator Ben Cardin, Representative Baragon, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and Representative Mfume for all of your years of leadership. And I want to recognize your next United States Senator, Angela Also Brooks. And I've worked with her over the years. I'm telling you, Marilyn, you're going to do a great thing when you send her to the United States Senate. And of course, I could speak all afternoon about the person that I am standing on this stage with. Thank you. Our extraordinary President, Joe Biden. And he's going to speak in a minute, but there's a lot of love in this room for our president. And I think it's for many, many reasons, including few leaders in our nation have done more on so many issues, including to expand access to affordable health care like Ben Joe Biden. And today we take the next step. Thank you, Joe. Forward in our fight. And today we take the next step. Thank you, Joe. Forward in our fight. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe.

It's a really one for far too many Americans. People like my dad used to lay in bed at night when they lost his insurance as the company worked for. Stare into the ceiling. Literally, you've all experienced, you know, people who have experiences. What in God's name happened if my wife gets breast cancer? Or if I get sick? Or my children get seriously ill? What happens? What in God's name? How can we pay for the drugs? Prescription drugs? I'm serious. These are just discussions. You know it. We have to have enough insurance. Can we afford the medical bills? We'll have to sell the house. You've got a second mortgage. Third of the discussions that took place in my house and your house. Common lie, both get it. You know it isn't just about healthcare. It's about your dignity. No, it's about your dignity. It's about peace of mind. It's about security. It's about taking care of your family. It's about giving folks just a little bit more breathing room. Look, I believe that healthcare should be a right not a privilege in America. And Camelot here today to make a major announcement on the reference to lower, lower the extraordinary high prescription drug prices. Before I do, I want to thank Governor Westmore. I served in the Senate for 270 years. I know only look 40, but I'm a little bit older. As long as time I was too damn young because I only looked 29 when I got elected. Now I'm too damn old. I'll tell you one thing in between. One of the finest, most decent men I've ever worked with. I think of my think of integrity as Ben Carden. Stand up, Ben. Stand up. I really mean it. I mentioned the people I worked with by their integrity. He does what he says and says what he does. Look, folks, also, you know, Nanette Barragan, for the longest time she tried to pretend with me she was Irish, her name Barragan. She's a great friend and she's one of the great leaders in this country for the Spanish community. Congressman Fumme, where are you? Stand up, man. I've never once gone to this man and asked for help when I haven't gotten it. Not one single time. Thank you, pal. Thank you. And you're soon to be Senator. First, the whole audience is job-meaning a county executive. I was a county official. They expect you can solve every problem you don't have authority or duty, you don't have enough money. I'm looking forward. I told her I campaigned for her against whichever helped the most. Along with members of my administration, Abir Basara, HHS, and his favorite Brooks Fassel, CNS administrators here today. And let me say something. We're all thinking about my good friend and he is a really good friend for a long time, Steny Hoyer. He represents the western shore of Delaware. You all think we're kidding. We have that fight all the time. I wish him a speedy recovery. Understand he's doing well. Folks, this is a fight. All of us have been fighting for a long time, taking on big pharma. We pay more for prescription drugs. It's not hyperbole. We pay more for prescriptions than any advanced nation in the world. I could take you out on Air Force One and if you have a prescription from a drug company in America and fly you to Toronto, Canada, fly you to Paris, France, fly you to Belphal, anywhere around the world and get you the same prescription for the same company for 40 to 60 percent less than we pay for it here. Too many Americans can't afford the drugs they badly need for life and death. So they skip doses, cut pills in half, forego prescriptions entirely because the prescription drugs are totally unaffordable. A woman I met, the nurse you just met, she's paying $9,000 a month. Guess what, she's going to pay nowhere near that. She's going to pay, guess what, beginning January, every single prescription drug she has, including God forbid if she needs a really expensive drug, a cancer drug, maximum she ever has to pay is $2,000 per year. That's right from the time I was in the Senate I worked tirelessly to get Medicare, the power to negotiate lower drug prices, just like the Department of Veterans Affairs. In fact, as we might imply staff today, one of the first major bills I worked on was in 1973. I co-sponsored legislation led by Senator Frank Church that let Medicare negotiate the cost of drugs. 1973 this fight's been going on. You know the VA pays as they should 50% less than Medicare because VA can negotiate the prices. But for years, big pharma blocked Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices. The consequence? They're able to maintain the exorbitant price increases in the professor on call for. Look, but this time we finally beat big pharma. And I might add, with no help from Republicans, not a single Republican voted for this bill, period, not one in the entire Congress. Now the reason I say that is not to make a political point about them, if they've gotten a lesson, but guess what? They want to, the guy we're running against, what's his name? Donald Dump or Donald, whatever. They want to get rid of this, what we passed. They're fighting to get rid of what we just passed. No, I'm serious. No help from Republicans passing inflation reduction thanks to the tie breaking vote of Kamala made it possible. Really matters. For example, take the insulin needed to treat diabetes. Guy who invented that insulin 100 years ago didn't put a patent on it because he wanted to be available for everybody. He didn't even patent it. Well, guess what happens to cost those companies to make that insulin? $10. That's the God's truth. $10. Number one. Number two, to package it and ship it, you might get it up to $13. But they were charging up to $400 bucks a month for it. But now they can't charge more than $35 a month. It's a big deal. $35 a month. These guys still make enormous profits. That's three times what it costs them to make it. The initial legislation kept the cost for everyone who needed that insulin. How many even know anybody needs insulin for diabetes? Raise your hand. Okay. Well, guess what? The next three months we got here, I'm not leaving here in Kamala when she's present going to make sure if we don't get it done. Everybody should qualify for that $35 a month. Every American. I mean it. Folks, that's not all. The same law I wrote, we wrote, means starting in January of this year, every senior in the United States of America, no matter what their cost of drugs. And like I said, some of these cancer drugs are $12,000 a year. Every single penny they spend, they never have to spend more than $2,000 a year for all drugs. All drugs. And we're going to fight to make sure everyone qualifies for that as well. Look, all together, our reform has not only saved lives, but there's the point people don't talk about. It saves the taxpayers billions of dollars. Well, we've done so far. We'll save the taxpayers in the next 10 years $160 billion. I mean it. Because they don't have to pay the price, the absorbent of price that Medicare had to pay before. They're going to pay $35 at a $400. Folks, I knew savings are only going to increase for American taxpayers because it matters. Look, but that's not all the inflation reduction act did last summer. I announced under that law Medicare is going to select and it's always passed law. 10 drugs a year going up to 20 till we get every single drug every year. Drugs treat from everything from heart failure, blood clots, kidney disease, arthritis, blood cancer, more. And today, I'm proud to announce that Medicare has reached agreement with all manufacturers on all 10 drugs selected in the first round of negotiations. The new lower prices for all 10 drugs will go in effect in January of 2026, not this January, next January. Negotiations cut the price of these 10 drugs for Judy and others who are Medicare nearly 40 to 80% depending on which drug it is. Let me give you one example. Non-insulin diabetes drugs cost $530 a month. Some of you may know that. Guess what? It's not only going to cost $115. By the way, these new prices on 10 drugs will cut only mean $1.5 billion less out of pocket for patients to the drug companies. Lower cofes for many of the 9 million seniors who take these drugs. That's not all. We're also saving the mirror in taxpayer because of the new changes. $6 billion a year because Medicare won't have to pay out that much. Imagine that. $6 billion a year. But we can do that for childcare and healthcare and so much more. We're just getting started. Under law, I signed Medicare. It can negotiate lower prices for another 15 drugs next year. 15 to fall in and 20 after that until every drug is covered. That's the law. Now, now. This is another really big deal. It means that Americans can save more money and from life saving medications they need to deserve. It brings peace of mind. It's hard to explain. Common eye are going to keep fighting and lower the precision drug cost for everyone. Not just seniors. It's a fight that we have to continue. Folks, but guess what? Surprise, surprise. Big former doesn't want this to happen at all. The pharmaceutical industry last year spent $400 million lobbying the Congress to stop this. $400 million. Worked pretty well. They didn't get one Republican vote for them. They all voted for them. Republican allies stuck with them. And the ability of the federal government to negotiate lower drug prices was tried to be stopped. The common line all of us in this room are going to keep standing up for big pharma. I fought too damn hard to yield now. We're not backing down. And get this. You may have heard about the Magna Republican project 2025 plan. They want to repeal Medicare's power to negotiate drug prices. Let big pharma back to charge them whatever they want. Let me tell you what our project 2025 is. Beat the hell out of them. I mean it. In January, 25 total percentage of drugs cost will be capped at 2000 no matter how expensive they are. In summer, 12 a year, 12,000 a month, I should say. Commonly, Congress will make sure that $2000 cap covers everyone, not just seniors as well. In summer, 35 for everyone, not just seniors. Our project 25 will lower particular drugs costs for you, your families, instead of handing big pharma a big blank check. And look, and in the process, this is what we don't talk enough about. I don't think. In the process, we're going to save the taxpayer. The budget's going to be reduced by hundreds of billions of dollars. Hear me? Hundreds of billions of dollars. Just the first year, the first thing we passed is $160 billion less that the government's going to have to pay out to pharma. But guess what? It can pay out for education, it can pay out for healthcare, it can pay out for so much more, or it can just simply reduce the deficit that he has exploded. Folks, that's what I call a win. Folks are more, my predecessor and his migrant friends in Congress tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which is a different, Obamacare. They tried to repeal it over 50 times. We stopped them. Along the way, I made the Affordable Care Act even stronger. It's like a million more Americans are free to exist in conditions. Guess what? There's over 40 million. And the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the

2024-08-15,Event,"Harris delivered remarks in Largo, Maryland",chunk,"Good afternoon everybody. My name is Judy Akin. I'm a 70 year old retired registered nurse from Portland, Maine. Where I live with my husband of 47 years, our two beagles and our son and granddaughter live nearby. Also for over four decades I've battled psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. That's taken a heavy toll on my body. But nothing could prepare me for the financial strain that came with the high cost of the drugs I need to live my life. Including enbrel which comes with a staggering list price. Last year alone I spent over $9,000 out of pocket just to afford this one drug. As a nurse I counseled patients on the importance of taking their medications consistently. But I have to admit that sometimes I found myself unable to follow my own advice and have been known to skip a dose here and there. For years it felt like no one was standing up to big pharma for patients like me. But thanks to President Biden and Vice President Harris's Inflation Reduction Act, that is changing. Now, enbrel is one of the first ten drugs up for Medicare negotiation. The thought of a lower list price for this essential medication feels like a lifeline. President Biden didn't just make a promise, he kept it. Because of the Biden-Harris administration's actions, my husband and I can finally breathe a little easier. That's why it is my great honor to introduce the team who leads the fight to put patients above profits. The President of the United States, Joe Biden and Vice President Pamela Harris. I'm just gonna shut down the shut deal and sweep the door. When the hook, the catapults stay in the room. When the run, here in the evil room. We take care of that room. We take care of that room. Where every slice of time. Good afternoon. Good afternoon everyone. Can we please applaud Judy? I love you guys. It's good to see so many friends. It is good to see so many friends. And I want to thank you. Thank you. And let's please thank you. I love you back. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I know we all thank Judy for sharing her story.",chunk_1,375

That work being what? To care about other people in a way that is about lifting them up and caring about their well-being. So Judy, we thank you so very much for being here today. I want to recognize the incredible Governor Wes Moore. Who's here with Don and his son. And Wes, I am so thankful to you for all that you do in service to our nation in so many different ways. And your friendship. But in particular, to share such a personal story as you have. And I know it takes a lot out of you to share that story. But to do it in a way that is about lifting up other people and helping hopefully others who are not in this room, understanding how real people are impacted every day about this issue and by this issue. Thank you. I want to recognize the people of our administration, including Secretary Becerra, who is here. The bold administrator of Brooks LaSour, who is here. My dear friend and former colleague, Senator Ben Cardin, Representative Baragon, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and Representative Mfume for all of your years of leadership. And I want to recognize your next United States Senator, Angela Also Brooks. And I've worked with her over the years. I'm telling you, Marilyn, you're going to do a great thing when you send her to the United States Senate. And of course, I could speak all afternoon about the person that I am standing on this stage with. Thank you. Our extraordinary President, Joe Biden. And he's going to speak in a minute, but there's a lot of love in this room for our president. And I think it's for many, many reasons, including few leaders in our nation have done more on so many issues, including to expand access to affordable health care like Ben Joe Biden.

People like my dad used to lay in bed at night when they lost his insurance as the company worked for. Stare into the ceiling. Literally, you've all experienced, you know, people who have experiences. What in God's name happened if my wife gets breast cancer? Or if I get sick? Or my children get seriously ill? What happens? What in God's name? How can we pay for the drugs? Prescription drugs? I'm serious. These are just discussions. You know it. We have to have enough insurance. Can we afford the medical bills? We'll have to sell the house. You've got a second mortgage. Third of the discussions that took place in my house and your house. Common lie, both get it. You know it isn't just about healthcare. It's about your dignity. No, it's about your dignity. It's about peace of mind. It's about security. It's about taking care of your family. It's about giving folks just a little bit more breathing room. Look, I believe that healthcare should be a right not a privilege in America. And Camelot here today to make a major announcement on the reference to lower, lower the extraordinary high prescription drug prices. Before I do, I want to thank Governor Westmore. I served in the Senate for 270 years. I know only look 40, but I'm a little bit older. As long as time I was too damn young because I only looked 29 when I got elected. Now I'm too damn old. I'll tell you one thing in between. One of the finest, most decent men I've ever worked with. I think of my think of integrity as Ben Carden. Stand up, Ben. Stand up. I really mean it. I mentioned the people I worked with by their integrity. He does what he says and says what he does. Look, folks, also, you know, Nanette Barragan, for the longest time she tried to pretend with me she was Irish, her name Barragan. She's a great friend and she's one of the great leaders in this country for the Spanish community. Congressman Fumme, where are you? Stand up, man.

2024-08-15,Event,"Harris delivered remarks in Largo, Maryland",chunk,"Not one single time. Thank you, pal. Thank you. And you're soon to be Senator. First, the whole audience is job-meaning a county executive. I was a county official. They expect you can solve every problem you don't have authority or duty, you don't have enough money. I'm looking forward. I told her I campaigned for her against whichever helped the most. Along with members of my administration, Abir Basara, HHS, and his favorite Brooks Fassel, CNS administrators here today. And let me say something. We're all thinking about my good friend and he is a really good friend for a long time, Steny Hoyer. He represents the western shore of Delaware. You all think we're kidding. We have that fight all the time. I wish him a speedy recovery. Understand he's doing well. Folks, this is a fight. All of us have been fighting for a long time, taking on big pharma. We pay more for prescription drugs. It's not hyperbole. We pay more for prescriptions than any advanced nation in the world. I could take you out on Air Force One and if you have a prescription from a drug company in America and fly you to Toronto, Canada, fly you to Paris, France, fly you to Belphal, anywhere around the world and get you the same prescription for the same company for 40 to 60 percent less than we pay for it here. Too many Americans can't afford the drugs they badly need for life and death. So they skip doses, cut pills in half, forego prescriptions entirely because the prescription drugs are totally unaffordable. A woman I met, the nurse you just met, she's paying $9,000 a month. Guess what, she's going to pay nowhere near that. She's going to pay, guess what, beginning January, every single prescription drug she has, including God forbid if she needs a really expensive drug, a cancer drug, maximum she ever has to pay is $2,000 per year. That's right from the time I was in the Senate I worked tirelessly to get Medicare, the power to negotiate lower drug prices, just like the Department of Veterans Affairs. In fact, as we might imply staff today, one of the first major bills I worked on was in 1973.",chunk_6,378
2024-08-15,Event,"Harris delivered remarks in Largo, Maryland",chunk,"I co-sponsored legislation led by Senator Frank Church that let Medicare negotiate the cost of drugs. 1973 this fight's been going on. You know the VA pays as they should 50% less than Medicare because VA can negotiate the prices. But for years, big pharma blocked Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices. The consequence? They're able to maintain the exorbitant price increases in the professor on call for. Look, but this time we finally beat big pharma. And I might add, with no help from Republicans, not a single Republican voted for this bill, period, not one in the entire Congress. Now the reason I say that is not to make a political point about them, if they've gotten a lesson, but guess what? They want to, the guy we're running against, what's his name? Donald Dump or Donald, whatever. They want to get rid of this, what we passed. They're fighting to get rid of what we just passed. No, I'm serious. No help from Republicans passing inflation reduction thanks to the tie breaking vote of Kamala made it possible. Really matters. For example, take the insulin needed to treat diabetes. Guy who invented that insulin 100 years ago didn't put a patent on it because he wanted to be available for everybody. He didn't even patent it. Well, guess what happens to cost those companies to make that insulin? $10. That's the God's truth. $10. Number one. Number two, to package it and ship it, you might get it up to $13. But they were charging up to $400 bucks a month for it. But now they can't charge more than $35 a month. It's a big deal. $35 a month. These guys still make enormous profits. That's three times what it costs them to make it. The initial legislation kept the cost for everyone who needed that insulin. How many even know anybody needs insulin for diabetes? Raise your hand. Okay. Well, guess what? The next three months we got here, I'm not leaving here in Kamala when she's present going to make sure if we don't get it done. Everybody should qualify for that $35 a month. Every American. I mean it. Folks, that's not all.",chunk_7,370
2024-08-15,Event,"Harris delivered remarks in Largo, Maryland",chunk,"The same law I wrote, we wrote, means starting in January of this year, every senior in the United States of America, no matter what their cost of drugs. And like I said, some of these cancer drugs are $12,000 a year. Every single penny they spend, they never have to spend more than $2,000 a year for all drugs. All drugs. And we're going to fight to make sure everyone qualifies for that as well. Look, all together, our reform has not only saved lives, but there's the point people don't talk about. It saves the taxpayers billions of dollars. Well, we've done so far. We'll save the taxpayers in the next 10 years $160 billion. I mean it. Because they don't have to pay the price, the absorbent of price that Medicare had to pay before. They're going to pay $35 at a $400. Folks, I knew savings are only going to increase for American taxpayers because it matters. Look, but that's not all the inflation reduction act did last summer. I announced under that law Medicare is going to select and it's always passed law. 10 drugs a year going up to 20 till we get every single drug every year. Drugs treat from everything from heart failure, blood clots, kidney disease, arthritis, blood cancer, more. And today, I'm proud to announce that Medicare has reached agreement with all manufacturers on all 10 drugs selected in the first round of negotiations. The new lower prices for all 10 drugs will go in effect in January of 2026, not this January, next January. Negotiations cut the price of these 10 drugs for Judy and others who are Medicare nearly 40 to 80% depending on which drug it is. Let me give you one example. Non-insulin diabetes drugs cost $530 a month. Some of you may know that. Guess what? It's not only going to cost $115. By the way, these new prices on 10 drugs will cut only mean $1.5 billion less out of pocket for patients to the drug companies. Lower cofes for many of the 9 million seniors who take these drugs. That's not all. We're also saving the mirror in taxpayer because of the new changes. $6 billion a year because Medicare won't have to pay out that much.",chunk_8,384
2024-08-15,Event,"Harris delivered remarks in Largo, Maryland",chunk,"Imagine that. $6 billion a year. But we can do that for childcare and healthcare and so much more. We're just getting started. Under law, I signed Medicare. It can negotiate lower prices for another 15 drugs next year. 15 to fall in and 20 after that until every drug is covered. That's the law. Now, now. This is another really big deal. It means that Americans can save more money and from life saving medications they need to deserve. It brings peace of mind. It's hard to explain. Common eye are going to keep fighting and lower the precision drug cost for everyone. Not just seniors. It's a fight that we have to continue. Folks, but guess what? Surprise, surprise. Big former doesn't want this to happen at all. The pharmaceutical industry last year spent $400 million lobbying the Congress to stop this. $400 million. Worked pretty well. They didn't get one Republican vote for them. They all voted for them. Republican allies stuck with them. And the ability of the federal government to negotiate lower drug prices was tried to be stopped. The common line all of us in this room are going to keep standing up for big pharma. I fought too damn hard to yield now. We're not backing down. And get this. You may have heard about the Magna Republican project 2025 plan. They want to repeal Medicare's power to negotiate drug prices. Let big pharma back to charge them whatever they want. Let me tell you what our project 2025 is. Beat the hell out of them. I mean it. In January, 25 total percentage of drugs cost will be capped at 2000 no matter how expensive they are. In summer, 12 a year, 12,000 a month, I should say. Commonly, Congress will make sure that $2000 cap covers everyone, not just seniors as well. In summer, 35 for everyone, not just seniors. Our project 25 will lower particular drugs costs for you, your families, instead of handing big pharma a big blank check. And look, and in the process, this is what we don't talk enough about. I don't think. In the process, we're going to save the taxpayer. The budget's going to be reduced by hundreds of billions of dollars.",chunk_9,378

Just the first year, the first thing we passed is $160 billion less that the government's going to have to pay out to pharma. But guess what? It can pay out for education, it can pay out for healthcare, it can pay out for so much more, or it can just simply reduce the deficit that he has exploded. Folks, that's what I call a win. Folks are more, my predecessor and his migrant friends in Congress tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which is a different, Obamacare. They tried to repeal it over 50 times. We stopped them.

I tell you what, I thank God that in the last three months I'm President of the United States, I was able to finally get done when I tried to get done when I was a young senator 30 years ago. Thank you God, thank you. God bless you all and may God protect our truth. And I'll be at your side forever.",chunk_12,66
2024-08-20,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. (need clipping)",full,"This state produces incredible leaders like my friend and former colleague, Congresswoman Gwynne Moore. Mayor of this great city, Mayor Johnson, give it up, give it up, give it up. And while she's not with us, we have got to hold the United States Senate. Send Tammy Baldwin back to D.C. You know, it was only a month ago that the Republican Party gathered there for their convention right here on this very spot. It doesn't sound like any of you watched it, but in case you didn't, after promising us a speech that was going to be about unity and promising that he was a changed man, Donald Trump subjected us to 92 minutes of ranting and raving insanity. Now look, they left here riding high. They were feeling good. This thing was over. Well, trust me, Milwaukee, a hell of a lot can change in four weeks. You run a campaign based on fear like them. You're going to run into a little trouble when you run into a campaign that's based on joy. These guys are focused on the past, like the 1850s past. This campaign is focused on your future. We're not going back. Wow. Wow. Here's the deal. Here's the deal. That convention had one purpose, to coordinate one man. Ours, by the way, they got a little party going over in Chicago. They didn't know the big party was here in Milwaukee tonight. This is where it's at. It's not a celebration of a coronation of one man over there. It's a celebration of all of us over there. I don't imagine anybody will pay any attention, but when I came out here, you might have heard over there that convention and the energy over there is like nothing you've seen, but here's what I'm really excited about. Not only do we have massive energy at our convention, we got a hell of a lot more energy at where they had their convention right here. This. Yeah. Oh, that one guy is going to be so sad tonight, so sad, so sad, so sad. Look, we got to turn the page on these guys. We got to turn the page. And here's the thing. Over the last two weeks, whether you saw it in Philly, you saw it out in the fields of Eau Claire, where some of you were out there. Amazing. On to Phoenix, where the largest political gathering in state history happened last week. Folks stood in 109 degree heat in Las Vegas. A thousand couldn't get in. So they all signed up to doorknock and phone bank instead of getting in there. That's what they're doing. And here is what is so great about it. All those people across this country, just like this crowd of 15,000 plus people sitting here. They all came for the same reason. You love this country. That's why you came. Yeah. My notes said this campaign has a lot of momentum. Can you feel it? Hell, yes, we can feel it. It's what we do. It's what we do. Something's happening for those of you in here and for the young folks in here. Some of you, something's happening. And it all begins with Kamala Harris. From a first day as a prosecutor, and she took those words, Kamala Harris, for the people, for the attorney general of California, to a United States senator, to our vice president, she has gone to work every day to fight on the side of you and the American people. Took on the predators, took on the fraudsters, took down the transnational gangs, stood up to powerful corporations. And she never, in all that work, and don't forget this, they don't want you to hear the true story. She did it reaching across the aisle, and she did what was ever necessary to get it right for the American people, to get it right for the people. Look, these shared American values, you see it across this country, but I can tell you what, Donald Trump doesn't see the world the way we see it. This guy weakens our country, mocks our laws, sows chaos and division amongst all of us. And here's the thing, they're not even hiding it. What he's planning to do is even worse. Now look, these guys are trying to hide what they're doing. They're trying to figure out what it is. And I've said this, I coached high school football long enough to know. Don't ever close the yearbook. Don't ever close that yearbook. But look, I know if you're going to take the time to draw up a playbook, you plan on using it. So this Project 2025 thing, it is simply the playbook. And they're going to call the plays straight down the line. And it always starts with the same old crap. Rig the economy for those at the top and screw the people at the bottom. That's what they do. Before costs go up, they repeal the Affordable Care Act and bring us back to pre-existing conditions. They cut Social Security and Medicare, the very things that keeps my mom out of poverty. They will ban abortion across this country. Make no doubt about it. Make no doubt about it. And J.D. Vance, he writes the foreword for the architect of the Project 2025. Look, you can find joy in the world everywhere. Here's where I find my joy. On October 1st, we're going to have a little talk. He and I on the same stage. So, yeah. So look, we're going to bring this country together. And those of you with no hair or gray hair remember when Republicans talked about freedom, the old Republicans, they actually meant it. They wouldn't turn their backs on our allies. They would try and do what's right. But these guys are not them. When they mean freedom, they want the freedom of government to be in your exam room. They mean freedom for corporations to pollute our air and water. Freedom for banks to take advantage of the least fortunate amongst us. And I've said this. We are cousins out here. You know this. In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors. We respect their personal choices. Even if we would not make the same choices our neighbors, we respect them because we live by that golden rule. Mind your own damn business. Mind your own damn business. I don't need you in our exam room. I don't need you telling me which books to read. And you can sure stay the hell out of our bedroom. So that's it. So look, I couldn't be prouder to be on the ticket and to help make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States. Tomorrow, I'll get to give a little speech over in Chicago, formally accept the nomination of you. On Thursday, Kamala will do the same thing and she'll lay out a vision for a new way forward. So look. We're over there today. We're here now. We're going to go back and catch the after parties over there because here's the deal. We got 77 days. 77 days to change the world. 77 days to bring decency. 77 days. Because look, we are not waking up on that 78th day. We are not waking up without knowing we left it all on the field. I've been saying it. You've done it. You've done it. Sleep when we're dead, but do the work now. Sleep when we're dead, but do the work now. This campaign is simple. We believe in the promise of America. It's that simple. So because as the next president of the United States says every single day, when we fight, when we fight, when we fight, thank you Milwaukee.

2024-08-20,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. (need clipping)",chunk,"This state produces incredible leaders like my friend and former colleague, Congresswoman Gwynne Moore. Mayor of this great city, Mayor Johnson, give it up, give it up, give it up. And while she's not with us, we have got to hold the United States Senate. Send Tammy Baldwin back to D.C. You know, it was only a month ago that the Republican Party gathered there for their convention right here on this very spot. It doesn't sound like any of you watched it, but in case you didn't, after promising us a speech that was going to be about unity and promising that he was a changed man, Donald Trump subjected us to 92 minutes of ranting and raving insanity. Now look, they left here riding high. They were feeling good. This thing was over. Well, trust me, Milwaukee, a hell of a lot can change in four weeks. You run a campaign based on fear like them. You're going to run into a little trouble when you run into a campaign that's based on joy. These guys are focused on the past, like the 1850s past. This campaign is focused on your future. We're not going back. Wow. Wow. Here's the deal. Here's the deal. That convention had one purpose, to coordinate one man. Ours, by the way, they got a little party going over in Chicago. They didn't know the big party was here in Milwaukee tonight. This is where it's at. It's not a celebration of a coronation of one man over there. It's a celebration of all of us over there. I don't imagine anybody will pay any attention, but when I came out here, you might have heard over there that convention and the energy over there is like nothing you've seen, but here's what I'm really excited about. Not only do we have massive energy at our convention, we got a hell of a lot more energy at where they had their convention right here. This. Yeah. Oh, that one guy is going to be so sad tonight, so sad, so sad, so sad. Look, we got to turn the page on these guys. We got to turn the page. And here's the thing. Over the last two weeks, whether you saw it in Philly, you saw it out in the fields of Eau Claire, where some of you were out there.",chunk_1,398
2024-08-20,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. (need clipping)",chunk,"Amazing. On to Phoenix, where the largest political gathering in state history happened last week. Folks stood in 109 degree heat in Las Vegas. A thousand couldn't get in. So they all signed up to doorknock and phone bank instead of getting in there. That's what they're doing. And here is what is so great about it. All those people across this country, just like this crowd of 15,000 plus people sitting here. They all came for the same reason. You love this country. That's why you came. Yeah. My notes said this campaign has a lot of momentum. Can you feel it? Hell, yes, we can feel it. It's what we do. It's what we do. Something's happening for those of you in here and for the young folks in here. Some of you, something's happening. And it all begins with Kamala Harris. From a first day as a prosecutor, and she took those words, Kamala Harris, for the people, for the attorney general of California, to a United States senator, to our vice president, she has gone to work every day to fight on the side of you and the American people. Took on the predators, took on the fraudsters, took down the transnational gangs, stood up to powerful corporations. And she never, in all that work, and don't forget this, they don't want you to hear the true story. She did it reaching across the aisle, and she did what was ever necessary to get it right for the American people, to get it right for the people. Look, these shared American values, you see it across this country, but I can tell you what, Donald Trump doesn't see the world the way we see it. This guy weakens our country, mocks our laws, sows chaos and division amongst all of us. And here's the thing, they're not even hiding it. What he's planning to do is even worse. Now look, these guys are trying to hide what they're doing. They're trying to figure out what it is. And I've said this, I coached high school football long enough to know. Don't ever close the yearbook. Don't ever close that yearbook. But look, I know if you're going to take the time to draw up a playbook, you plan on using it.",chunk_2,385
2024-08-20,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. (need clipping)",chunk,"So this Project 2025 thing, it is simply the playbook. And they're going to call the plays straight down the line. And it always starts with the same old crap. Rig the economy for those at the top and screw the people at the bottom. That's what they do. Before costs go up, they repeal the Affordable Care Act and bring us back to pre-existing conditions. They cut Social Security and Medicare, the very things that keeps my mom out of poverty. They will ban abortion across this country. Make no doubt about it. Make no doubt about it. And J.D. Vance, he writes the foreword for the architect of the Project 2025. Look, you can find joy in the world everywhere. Here's where I find my joy. On October 1st, we're going to have a little talk. He and I on the same stage. So, yeah. So look, we're going to bring this country together. And those of you with no hair or gray hair remember when Republicans talked about freedom, the old Republicans, they actually meant it. They wouldn't turn their backs on our allies. They would try and do what's right. But these guys are not them. When they mean freedom, they want the freedom of government to be in your exam room. They mean freedom for corporations to pollute our air and water. Freedom for banks to take advantage of the least fortunate amongst us. And I've said this. We are cousins out here. You know this. In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors. We respect their personal choices. Even if we would not make the same choices our neighbors, we respect them because we live by that golden rule. Mind your own damn business. Mind your own damn business. I don't need you in our exam room. I don't need you telling me which books to read. And you can sure stay the hell out of our bedroom. So that's it. So look, I couldn't be prouder to be on the ticket and to help make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States. Tomorrow, I'll get to give a little speech over in Chicago, formally accept the nomination of you. On Thursday, Kamala will do the same thing and she'll lay out a vision for a new way forward.",chunk_3,385

We're going to go back and catch the after parties over there because here's the deal. We got 77 days. 77 days to change the world. 77 days to bring decency. 77 days. Because look, we are not waking up on that 78th day. We are not waking up without knowing we left it all on the field. I've been saying it. You've done it. You've done it. Sleep when we're dead, but do the work now. Sleep when we're dead, but do the work now. This campaign is simple. We believe in the promise of America. It's that simple.

2024-08-22,Event,Harris Democratic nomination speech,full,"Please welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Vice President of the United States of America, Kamala Harris. Freedom, freedom, I can't move. Freedom, come and lose track. Freedom, freedom, I want you. I need freedom too. I break today's I've got myself. And let my freedom run in hell. Hey, I'ma keep running cause the winner don't quid on themselves. Good evening. I'ma keep running. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening, everyone. Good evening.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so very much. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Let's get to business. Let's get to business. All right. So, let me start by thanking my most incredible husband, Doug for being an incredible partner to me and incredible father to Colin Ella and happy anniversary, Dougie. I love you so very much. To our President, Joe Biden. When I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary as history will show and your character is inspiring and Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both. And to Coach Tim Walls, you are going to be an incredible Vice President. And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign, your support is humbling. So, America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected. But I'm no stranger to unlikely journeys. So, my mother, our mother, had one of her own and I miss her every day and especially right now. And I know she's looking down smiling. I know that. So, my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer. When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage. But as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. They fell in love and got married and that act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me. And I'm sure that she'll never forget that. Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck packed with all our belongings ready to go to Illinois, to Wisconsin, and wherever our parents' jobs took us. My early memories were a home filled with laughter and music, Aretha, Coltrane, and Miles at the park. My mother would say stay close. But my father would say as he smiled, run Kamala, run, don't be afraid, don't let anything stop you. From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless. But the harmony between my parents did not last. When I was in elementary school, they split up. And it was mostly my mother who raised us. Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. In the Bay, in the Bay, you either live in the hills or the flat lands. We lived in the flats. A beautiful, working class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers. All who tended their lawns with pride. My mother, she worked long hours. And like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us. Mrs. Shelton, who ran the daycare below us and became a second mother. Uncle Sherman, Aunt Mary, Uncle Freddy, Aunty Chris, none of them family by blood and all of them family by love. Family family by love. Family who taught us how to make gumbo, how to play chess, and sometimes even let us win. Family who loved us, believed in us and told us we could be anything and do anything. They instilled in us the values they personified. Community, faith, and importance of treating others as you would want to be treated. With kindness, respect, and compassion. My mother was a brilliant five foot tall brown woman with an accent. And as the eldest child, as the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her. But my mother never lost her cool. She was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for women's health. And she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never complain about injustice, but do something about it. Do something about it. That was my mother. And she taught us and she always, she also taught us and never do anything half-assed. And that is a direct quote. A direct quote. I grew up immersed in the ideals of the civil rights movement. My parents had met at a civil rights gathering and they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders including the lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker Motley. Those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America. So at a young age I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. And when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life. You see when I was in high school I started to notice something about my best friend Wanda. She was sad at school. And there were times she didn't want to go home. So one day I asked if everything was all right. And she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us. And she did. This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor to protect people like Wanda. Because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity, and to justice. As a prosecutor when I had a case I charged it not in the name of the victim but in the name of the people. For a simple reason in our system of justice a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime, to remind them no one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. And every day in the courtroom I stood proudly before a judge and I said five words Kamala Harris for the people. And to be clear and to be clear my entire career I've only had one client the people. And so on behalf of the people on behalf of every American regardless of party race gender or the language your grandmother speaks on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with people who work hard chase their dreams and look out for one another on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on earth. I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America. And with this election and and and with this election our nation our nation with this election has a precious fleeting opportunity to move past cynicism and divisive battles of the past a chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction but as Americans. And let me say I know there are people of various political views watching tonight and I want you to know I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self to hold sacred America's fundamental principles from the rule of law to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power. I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations a president who leads and listens who is realistic practical and has common sense and always fights for the American people. I am a president who is a president from the courthouse to the white house that has been my life's work. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. I spent $100 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation. I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for profit colleges for workers who are being cheated out of their wages they were due for seniors facing elder abuse. I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities. And I will tell you these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. We were underestimated at practically every turn but we never gave up because the future is always worth fighting for. And that's the fight we are in right now a fight for America's future. Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives it is one of the most important in the life of our nation. In many ways Donald Trump is an unserious man but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. Consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. And I think Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help he did the opposite he fanned the flames and now for an entirely different set of crimes he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans and separately and separately found liable for committing sexual abuse and consider consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol. His explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents and anyone he sees as the enemy. His explicit intent to deploy our active duty military against our own citizens. Consider consider the power he will have especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails and how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States not to improve your life not to strengthen our national security but to serve the only client he has ever had himself and we know and we know what a second Trump term would look like. It's all laid out in Project 2025 written by his closest advisors and it's some total is to pull our country back to the past but America we are not going back. to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare we are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions we are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools we are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide pre-school and childcare for our children America we are not going back America we are not going back and we are charting and we are charting a new way forward forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success and building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency and I'll tell you this is personal for me the middle class is where I come from my mother kept a strict budget we lived within our means yet we wanted for little and she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them because as she taught us opportunity is not available to everyone that's why we will create what I call an opportunity economy an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed whether you live in a rural area small town or big city and as president I will bring together labor and workers and small business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries we will provide access to capital for small business owners and entrepreneurs and founders and we will end America's housing shortage and protect social security and Medicare now compare that to Donald Trump because I think everyone here knows he doesn't actually fight for the middle class he doesn't actually fight for the middle class instead he fights for himself and his billionaire friends and he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add up to 5 trillion dollars to the national debt and all the while he intends to enact what in effect is a national sales tax call it a Trump tax that would raise prices on middle class families by almost $4,000 a year well instead of a Trump tax hike we will pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans friends I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives especially on matters of heart and home but tonight in America too many women are not able to make those decisions and let's be clear about how we got here Donald Trump hand picked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom and now he brags about it in his words quote I did it and I'm proud to say it and I'm proud to say it and I'm proud to say it and quote well I'll tell you over the past two years I've traveled across our country and women have told me their stories husbands and fathers have shared theirs stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot and doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients couples just trying to grow their family cut off in the middle of IVF treatments children who have survived sexual assault potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term this is what's happening in our country because of Donald Trump and understand he is not done as a part of his agenda he and his allies would limit access to birth control ban medication abortion and enact a nationwide abortion ban with or without congress and get this get this he plans to create a national abortion coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions simply put they are out of their minds and one must ask one must ask why exactly do you think women are not women and one must ask why exactly is it that they don't trust women well we trust women we trust women and when congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as president of the united states I will proudly sign it into law and I will sign it into law and I will sign it into law and I will sign it into law and I will sign it into law and I will sign it into law and I will

His explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents and anyone he sees as the enemy. His explicit intent to deploy our active duty military against our own citizens. Consider consider the power he will have especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails and how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States not to improve your life not to strengthen our national security but to serve the only client he has ever had himself and we know and we know what a second Trump term would look like. It's all laid out in Project 2025 written by his closest advisors and it's some total is to pull our country back to the past but America we are not going back.",chunk_5,309
2024-08-22,Event,Harris Democratic nomination speech,chunk,"to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare we are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions we are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools we are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide pre-school and childcare for our children America we are not going back America we are not going back and we are charting and we are charting a new way forward forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success and building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency and I'll tell you this is personal for me the middle class is where I come from my mother kept a strict budget we lived within our means yet we wanted for little and she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them because as she taught us opportunity is not available to everyone that's why we will create what I call an opportunity economy an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed whether you live in a rural area small town or big city and as president I will bring together labor and workers and small business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries we will provide access to capital for small business owners and entrepreneurs and founders and we will end America's housing shortage and protect social security and Medicare now compare that to Donald Trump because I think everyone here knows he doesn't actually fight for the middle class he doesn't actually fight for the middle class instead he fights for himself and his billionaire friends and he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add up to 5 trillion dollars to the national debt and all the while he intends to enact what in effect is a national sales tax call it a Trump tax that would raise prices on middle class families by almost $4,000 a year well instead of a Trump tax hike we will pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans friends I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives especially on matters of heart and home but tonight in America too many women are not able to make those decisions and let's be clear about how we got here Donald Trump hand picked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom and now he brags about it in his words quote I did it and I'm proud to say it and I'm proud to say it and I'm proud to say it and quote well I'll tell you over the past two years I've traveled across our country and women have told me their stories husbands and fathers have shared theirs stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot and doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients couples just trying to grow their family cut off in the middle of IVF treatments children who have survived sexual assault potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term this is what's happening in our country because of Donald Trump and understand he is not done as a part of his agenda he and his allies would limit access to birth control ban medication abortion and enact a nationwide abortion ban with or without congress and get this get this he plans to create a national abortion coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions simply put they are out of their minds and one must ask one must ask why exactly do you think women are not women and one must ask why exactly is it that they don't trust women well we trust women we trust women and when congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as president of the united states I will proudly sign it into law and I will sign it into law and I will sign it into law and I will

2024-08-29,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Savannah, Georgia",full,"I believe in God in heaven, hey I'm a keeper of the world, I'm a leader of the human world Good afternoon Savannah Good afternoon, oh good afternoon, oh it's good to be back in Savannah, good afternoon Can we please hear for Caitlin and her incredible incredible leadership Look when I look out at our young leaders like Caitlin I know our future is so bright It is so bright I want to thank Mayor Johnson, thank you for your there you are We've been hanging out for the last two days Mayor I thank you so very much for your leadership, thank you Congresswoman Nkeema Williams the chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia for your friendship and your sisterhood and to all the leaders with us today, good afternoon, good afternoon, good afternoon I also bring greetings from our president and a great friend of the state of Georgia, Joe Biden and let us also send our love to the great president from the state of Georgia, Jimmy Carter So Georgia, I love you back, I love you back and we have 68 days to go until this election 68 days to go and I think you all have spent your time here sacrificing all your other obligations to be here together us as one community knowing we all have so much more in common than what separates us and I thank you for taking that time and listen, so we're here to speak truth and one of the things that we know this is going to be a tight race until the very end so let's not play too much attention to the polls because we are running as the underdog and we have some hard work ahead of us but we like hard work, hard work is good work and with your help we are going to win this November we are going to win this November yes we will so look Georgia let me say I'm no stranger to tough fights before I was elected vice president before I was elected a United States Senator I was an elected attorney general and before that an elected district attorney and before that I was a courtroom prosecutor so every day in the courtroom I stood proudly before a judge and I spoke five words Kamala Harris for the people my entire career I've only had one client the people I stood for women and children against predators who abuse them I took on the big banks and delivered 20 billion dollars from middle class families who faced foreclosure I fought against cartels who trafficked in guns, drugs and human beings and I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for profit colleges for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due and for seniors facing elder abuse and I will tell you those fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices but we never gave up because the future is always worth fighting for always and that is the fight we are in right now a fight for America's future we fight for a future with affordable childcare paid leave and affordable health care and on that last subject let's finally expand Medicaid in Georgia so people can take their child to a doctor or go to an emergency room without going into medical debt we fight for a future where we build what I call an opportunity economy so that every American has the opportunity to own a home to start a business and to build wealth and intergenerational wealth and a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families so when I was Attorney General I went after price fixing schemes and love you back, love you back and I will tell you when we get this done together my friend and when I am President I will take on the bad actors who exploit a crisis to rip off consumers on everyday items to rip off consumers on everyday items like groceries I will take on big pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs and insulin for all Americans I will take on the high cost of housing and work with developers to cut the red tape and build millions of new homes and I will give 100 million Americans a tax cut including $6,000 to families during the first year of their child's life understanding folks just need a little help from time to time and it's not about just getting by, it's about getting ahead $6,000 in the first year of a child's life to help pay for that car seat or the crib or the baby clothes and unlike Donald Trump I will always put the middle class and working class families first always I come from the middle class, I know what I'm talking about Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump,

Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump and his Project 2025 agenda. If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He intends. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. And he wants to impose what in effect is a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities. And it will cost, the economists will tell you, it will cost a typical American family nearly $4,000 a year. So Georgia, on top of all of this, if Donald Trump wins in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. To take us back to a time when insurance companies, we're not going back. We're not going back. We are not going forward. And the reason we know we can't go back, to your point, the reason we know we can't go back on the issue of the Affordable Care Act, remember what that was like before we had the Affordable Care Act? Remember when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions? Remember what that was like, children with asthma? Breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes? So yeah, we're not going back. We're not going back. And we will move forward. We will move forward. Ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. Like the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. Why don't they trust women? Will we trust women? And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. And across our nation, in addition to that, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard fought, hard won fundamental freedoms and laws. Let me just say something. Hold on, hold up for a second. Hold up for a second. Let me just say something. Let me just say something. We are fighting for a democracy. Everyone has a right and should have their voices heard. I am speaking now. But on the subject, I will say this. The President and I are working around the clock. We've got to get a hostage deal done and get a ceasefire done now. So back to the selection and Donald Trump. So in addition to the fight on the fundamental freedom to make decisions about one's own body, I have been traveling our country and the people of Georgia know what I know. There is a full-on assault on hard fought, hard won freedoms and rights, including the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe, and gun violence. And an attack on the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. And we will fight against all of that, including the freedom to live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis. Here's the thing. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now, Savannah, the baton is in our hands. So we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis voting rights and ban from acts and the freedom to vote acts. We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks and red flag laws. So much is on the line in this election. So much is on the line. And understand this is not 2016 or 2020. Things are different. A lot is the same when we think about the issues and then there is significant differences. The stakes in 2024 are even higher. Because consider that the United States Supreme Court recently just basically told the former president that going forward he will be effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House. Now just imagine. Well, the courts are going to take care of that. We're going to elect ourselves and everybody here in November. But I mentioned the Supreme Court ruling because understand what this means. Just imagine before there was at least the threat of consequence. Understand what it now means and imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Imagine what that means when you consider he has openly vowed that if reelected on day one he will be a dictator. That he would end the independence of the Department of Justice so he could have unchecked power and seek vengeance against people who disagree with him. He even called for termination of the United States Supreme, the supreme land of our nation, the United States Constitution. Think about what that means and let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the Supreme Court. And the seal of the President of the United States of America. Never again. So it all comes down to this. We are all here together spending this time together because we love our country. We love our country. And we know the privilege and pride that comes with being American. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we realize the promise of America. Georgia for the past two election cycles. Voters in this very state. You who are here have delivered. You sent two extraordinary senators to Washington, D.C. You sent President Biden and me to the White House. You showed up. You knocked on doors. You registered folks to vote. And you made it happen. You did that. You did that. And so now we are asking you to do it again. Let's do it again. Let's do it again. So Savannah, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, God bless you and God bless the United States.",full,1928

Because consider that the United States Supreme Court recently just basically told the former president that going forward he will be effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House. Now just imagine. Well, the courts are going to take care of that. We're going to elect ourselves and everybody here in November. But I mentioned the Supreme Court ruling because understand what this means. Just imagine before there was at least the threat of consequence. Understand what it now means and imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Imagine what that means when you consider he has openly vowed that if reelected on day one he will be a dictator. That he would end the independence of the Department of Justice so he could have unchecked power and seek vengeance against people who disagree with him. He even called for termination of the United States Supreme, the supreme land of our nation, the United States Constitution.",chunk_3,374
2024-08-29,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Savannah, Georgia",chunk,"Think about what that means and let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the Supreme Court. And the seal of the President of the United States of America. Never again. So it all comes down to this. We are all here together spending this time together because we love our country. We love our country. And we know the privilege and pride that comes with being American. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we realize the promise of America. Georgia for the past two election cycles. Voters in this very state. You who are here have delivered. You sent two extraordinary senators to Washington, D.C. You sent President Biden and me to the White House. You showed up. You knocked on doors. You registered folks to vote. And you made it happen. You did that. You did that. And so now we are asking you to do it again. Let's do it again. Let's do it again. So Savannah, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, God bless you and God bless the United States.",chunk_4,237

2024-09-02,Rally,Harris held a rally in Pittsburg Pennsylvania (needs clipping ),full,"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were walking our picket lines when Donald Trump was crossing them. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have led the most pro-union White House in American history. And you remember that Kamala Harris cast those deciding votes in the Senate to save millions of workers' pensions and lower costs for seniors on their prescription drugs and make the biggest investment in modern history to rebuild this country. And now Kamala Harris and our union brother Tim Walz, yes, they are ready to go even further because they believe in that future that we all want to see. Now the road to the White House goes right through our union halls. That's right, one in five voters right here in Pennsylvania is a union voter. So we are the difference maker. We have the people. We have the trust. We know how to organize. And we are ready to send Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to the White House. Are we ready? All right, I got to hear you. Are you going to get your friends registered to vote? Yes. Are you going to knock on doors? Yes. Are you going to fight every day until November 5th? Yes. That's what I thought. Because when we fight, we fight. When we fight, we fight. Yes. Thank you. Now I have the great pleasure of introducing my friend, my brother, one of the great labor leaders in this country, IBEW International President, Kenny Cooper. Let's go, Cooper. Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. Good afternoon. Thank you, brothers and sisters. Thank you, guests. And most of all, thank you, family, for being here on Labor Day. You know, it's a great honor to be in Pittsburgh, a good union town, but for me, it's really an honor to be in the House of Labor. IBEW Local 5, thank you so much for everything you do. As Liz said, I'm the international president of the IBEW, the oldest and largest electrical union in the entire world. And on behalf of 840,000 members of the IBEW, it is my true honor to get to introduce tonight the strongest, most pro-union administration ever in history in the United States, President Biden and Vice President Harris. Joe Biden made a lot of promises when he run for president in 2022 or 2020. He promised to save Americans' pension system that was a serious risk for us. He promised to help American workers that were depending on him to help save that pension. Workers who went to work every day lived by the rules, who deferred their own wages so they could retire one day with dignity and respect. He passed the Butch Lewis Act, saving the American's multi-floor pension plan. And when the Senate was all tied up, let's think about this a minute, on the rescue of America's pension plans, they were only tied up for one reason. We couldn't find a Republican senator that would vote for American workers. Why would? The vice president and Harris showed us her real colors. She stepped to the plate, casted a deciding vote to save our pension plans across America. Showing working families that Biden and Harris administration has our backs, promises made, promises kept. He pledged to rebuild our country's infrastructure, the only way to make sense was good union jobs that pays well and has health care for them and their families. Once again, promises made, promises kept. They worked together to pass the Chips and Science Act, bringing back manufacturing jobs to communities that really need them the most. Promises made, promises kept. They pledged to be true friends of labor because they understand the necessity of unions to the American worker and to the middle class. Well, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris kept every single one of those promises. Pension plan relief, the Butch Lewis Act went above and beyond our expectations. His infrastructure bills are bringing good union jobs back, much needed infrastructure across our nation, in every corner of our nation. And he's never been afraid to say the word union. Joe Biden is more than just the pro union, the most pro union president in our entire history. When he passed the torch to Kamala Harris, he ensured his pro union, pro labor legacy would continue with the next administration. Kamala Harris understands just as Joe did and Joe does now. The only way to meet the future of this great nation is by giving workers a real voice at every table, especially the most important table to every worker and every worker's family, the kitchen table. Yeah. Brothers and sisters, please join me to welcome our true friends, the president and vice president of the United States, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

all state reps need the money but guess what under my administration to go straight to the county one of my best friends my name is Joe Bodnard from Scranton Pennsylvania Bobby Casey has been a great

say the word Union but you know what the fact of the matter is an awful lot of politicians have a trouble saying Union like they're working people guess what I'm not one of them in this common we know the simple truth Wall Street did not build America the middle class built America and unions built the middle class that's a fact by the way that is not a slogan that's a fact I asked the Treasury

Applause And in the process are you ready to make Donald Trump a loser again? Yes! I've never been more optimistic about America because we have to remember who we are we're the United States of America there's nothing, nothing, I mean this in the bottom of my heart there's nothing beyond our capacity nothing when we do it together and that means, like my friend our great Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Good afternoon Pittsburgh Applause Applause Thank you Joe Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause It is good to be in the House of Labor Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Now I don't have to tell the brothers and sisters of labor that you really get to know somebody when you're in the middle of a fight That's really great When times are hard When the forces are mighty When people don't believe something can get done and they have a thousand excuses for why it can't get done And I have spent more time with this extraordinary human being When the cameras were not in the room When the stakes were high When the heat was high When the heat was intense And Joe Biden has always stood with the workers of America and labor unions of America Always Always Applause Applause Applause I've been with him when he'll bring folks into the Oval Office and you know how Joe can get sometimes he doesn't spare words that sometimes the cameras are not in the room when he has those conversations Because the thing about the Joe Biden I know and I know you know because he has been a friend of labor for so long for his whole life Joe Biden can be quite impatient and that's a good thing for that kind of leader Quite impatient and I say to all of the friends here the press that's in the room history will show what we here know Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents in the United States that we have ever witnessed Applause Applause Applause And it comes from his heart Applause Applause Applause Applause And you know Joe and I talk a lot about the fact that we are so proud to be the most pro-Union administration in America's history Applause Applause Applause Applause And as we know Joe still got a lot of work to do so let's also understand that So I want to thank all the incredible leaders who are here today including the Governor Shapiro Lieutenant Governor Davis Senator Casey who we will re-elect this November Mayor Gaining President Scholar President Cooper all the leaders of labor who are here all the Union members who are here so I'll just get right to a few points I love Labor Day I love celebrating Labor Day And Pittsburgh of course is a cradle of the American Labor movement It is the birthplace of the AFL headquarters of the steel workers home to firefighters local one and of course the historic IBEW Local 5 Applause Applause Applause For more than 150 years the brothers and sisters of labor have helped lead the fight for fair pay better benefits and safe working conditions and every person in our nation has benefited from that work you know everywhere I go I tell people you may not be a union member but you better thank unions for that 5 day work week Applause Thank unions for sick leave Thank unions for pay family leave Applause Thank unions for your vacation time Applause Applause Because when union wages go up everybody's wages go up when union workplaces are safer all workplaces are safer when unions are strong America is strong Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause And we are clear not only has Pittsburgh shaped the history of America's labor movement today you are also shaping its future In 2021 with my dear friend the secretary Marty Walsh who the president appointed to be secretary of labor he and I hosted a meeting right here in this local and it was part of the White House Labor Task Force that I lead today we met with a group of computer programmers who were working to form a union one month later they signed their contract and became the first one of the first technology unions in our nation Applause Standing on the shoulder of all those who have been here and fought the good fight so Pittsburgh I remind us of that to say together we are fighting to build an economy that works for all working people Applause And that has always been the vision of the labor movement and that is the vision of our campaign you know in this election there are two very different visions for our nation one hours focused on the future the other focused on the past And the other focused on the future And the other focused on the future We fight for the future We fight for a future of dignity respect and opportunity for all people Applause Applause Applause We fight knowing it's some backward thinking for those folks who have been suggesting for years that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down You know that's the stuff they're pushing That the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down when we know the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up Applause Applause Who you lift up Applause Do you fight for workers? Do you fight for families? Do you fight for those who must be seen and heard and deserve the dignity that comes with hard work Applause That's what we fight for Applause And when you know what to stand for you know what to fight for Applause Applause So we're 64 days out from this election Laughter Laughter Ballots in Pennsylvania will start dropping in 14 days Applause 14 days Applause And this election is as much as anything else a fight for the promise of America Applause For the promise of America We love our country Applause And we know it is one of the highest forms of socialism to fight for the ideals of our country And that's what this election is about And about the promise of America And I don't need to tell unions what the promise looks like It's what you do every day Applause Applause Applause Applause But as we fight to move forward Donald Trump is trying to pull us backward Applause Including back to a time before workers had the freedom to organize Applause Well, the courts will handle that And we will handle November Applause Applause Applause We'll handle November, let the courts handle that Applause But we're not going back Applause Applause And one of the ways One of the ways we're going to guarantee we don't go back is that we remember Right? It is important to remember what that was and what it is Remember, as president Donald Trump blocked overtime benefits for millions of workers Applause He opposed efforts to raise the minimum wage Applause As the president said, he appointed union busters to the National Labor Relations Board Applause And don't forget, he supported so-called right to work laws Applause And if Donald Trump were to be re-elected he intends to give more tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations Applause He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare Applause He wants to impose what in effect would be a national sales tag I call it the Trump's national sales tag Applause On everyday products and basic necessities that would cost a typical American family the economist have said this Almost $4,000 a year Applause He intends to repeal the Affordable Care Act Applause And take us back to what we remember because it wasn't that long ago was a time when insurance companies could deny people pre-existing conditions Do you remember what that was? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors grandparents with diabetes Applause Well look America has tried those failed policies before and we are not going back Applause Applause Applause We are not going back Applause We are not going back Applause And instead we fight for a future where no person has to go broke just because they get sick Applause And so building on the work of President Joe Biden and I and the work we have done in the White House we will continue to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and make prescription drugs affordable for all Americans Applause We We fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to organize and we will pass the Pro Act Applause And end union busting once and for all and Bob Casey will help us do that Applause Applause Applause Applause We see and know and fight for a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead Applause And so we will continue to build what I call an opportunity economy so that every American has an opportunity to buy a home and start a business or build intergenerational wealth and have a future that matches their dreams and ambitions and aspirations Applause Because of course that's the nature of who we are as Americans We have dreams we can see what is possible unburdened by what has been We have aspirations We have ambitions and the system that is a good system is one that supports that and allows people the opportunity to go where they can see and imagine themselves to be That's what I'm talking about when I talk about an opportunity economy we fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity and so we will continue to defend Social Security and Medicare And pensions And pensions And pensions Applause And we will continue to strengthen America's manufacturing sector and on that point the President mentioned it U.S. Steel is an historic American company and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American Steel companies and I couldn't agree more with President Biden U.S. Steel should remain American owned and American operated Applause And I will always have the back of America's Steel workers Applause And all of America's workers Applause So friends 64 days until the most election of our lives and probably one of the most important in the life of our nation Truly And we know this is going to be a tight race to the very end It's going to be a tight race to the very end so let's not pay too much attention to those polls Because as unions and labor knows best we know what it's like to be the underdog And we are the underdog in this race And we have some hard work then ahead of us But here's the beauty of us in this room We like hard work Hard work is good work Hard work is joyful work Applause And so in this fight Applause I will continue to count on the strength, the determination and the hard work of the leaders in this room to knock on doors to get folks to the polls and bluntly put because the people in here do it to help us win Pennsylvania Applause So today I ask Are you ready to make your voices heard? Applause Do we believe in freedom? Applause Do we believe in opportunity? Applause Do we believe in the promise of America? Applause Are you ready to make your voice heard? Applause Are you ready to make your voice heard? Applause Are you ready to make your voice heard? Applause Are you ready to make your voice heard? Applause Are you ready to make your voice heard? Applause Are you ready to make your voice heard? Applause Are you ready to make your voice heard? Applause Are you ready to make your voice heard? Applause Are you ready to make your voice heard?

2024-09-02,Rally,Harris held a rally in Pittsburg Pennsylvania (needs clipping ),chunk,"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were walking our picket lines when Donald Trump was crossing them. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have led the most pro-union White House in American history. And you remember that Kamala Harris cast those deciding votes in the Senate to save millions of workers' pensions and lower costs for seniors on their prescription drugs and make the biggest investment in modern history to rebuild this country. And now Kamala Harris and our union brother Tim Walz, yes, they are ready to go even further because they believe in that future that we all want to see. Now the road to the White House goes right through our union halls. That's right, one in five voters right here in Pennsylvania is a union voter. So we are the difference maker. We have the people. We have the trust. We know how to organize. And we are ready to send Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to the White House. Are we ready? All right, I got to hear you. Are you going to get your friends registered to vote? Yes. Are you going to knock on doors? Yes. Are you going to fight every day until November 5th? Yes. That's what I thought. Because when we fight, we fight. When we fight, we fight. Yes. Thank you. Now I have the great pleasure of introducing my friend, my brother, one of the great labor leaders in this country, IBEW International President, Kenny Cooper. Let's go, Cooper. Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. Good afternoon. Thank you, brothers and sisters. Thank you, guests. And most of all, thank you, family, for being here on Labor Day. You know, it's a great honor to be in Pittsburgh, a good union town, but for me, it's really an honor to be in the House of Labor. IBEW Local 5, thank you so much for everything you do. As Liz said, I'm the international president of the IBEW, the oldest and largest electrical union in the entire world. And on behalf of 840,000 members of the IBEW, it is my true honor to get to introduce tonight the strongest, most pro-union administration ever in history in the United States, President Biden and Vice President Harris.",chunk_1,373
2024-09-02,Rally,Harris held a rally in Pittsburg Pennsylvania (needs clipping ),chunk,"Joe Biden made a lot of promises when he run for president in 2022 or 2020. He promised to save Americans' pension system that was a serious risk for us. He promised to help American workers that were depending on him to help save that pension. Workers who went to work every day lived by the rules, who deferred their own wages so they could retire one day with dignity and respect. He passed the Butch Lewis Act, saving the American's multi-floor pension plan. And when the Senate was all tied up, let's think about this a minute, on the rescue of America's pension plans, they were only tied up for one reason. We couldn't find a Republican senator that would vote for American workers. Why would? The vice president and Harris showed us her real colors. She stepped to the plate, casted a deciding vote to save our pension plans across America. Showing working families that Biden and Harris administration has our backs, promises made, promises kept. He pledged to rebuild our country's infrastructure, the only way to make sense was good union jobs that pays well and has health care for them and their families. Once again, promises made, promises kept. They worked together to pass the Chips and Science Act, bringing back manufacturing jobs to communities that really need them the most. Promises made, promises kept. They pledged to be true friends of labor because they understand the necessity of unions to the American worker and to the middle class. Well, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris kept every single one of those promises. Pension plan relief, the Butch Lewis Act went above and beyond our expectations. His infrastructure bills are bringing good union jobs back, much needed infrastructure across our nation, in every corner of our nation. And he's never been afraid to say the word union. Joe Biden is more than just the pro union, the most pro union president in our entire history. When he passed the torch to Kamala Harris, he ensured his pro union, pro labor legacy would continue with the next administration.",chunk_2,350

American politics everybody knows where you live and I think you can solve all the problems you don't have enough money well I tell you one thing I'm the first president ever I used to be a county official when I was 26 years old and always bothered me the federal government would send money to the state to be distributed to the county and what the hell the state going to send to the county for all state reps need the money but guess what under my administration to go straight to the county one of my best friends my name is Joe Bodnard from Scranton Pennsylvania Bobby Casey has been a great

say the word Union but you know what the fact of the matter is an awful lot of politicians have a trouble saying Union like they're working people guess what I'm not one of them in this common we know the simple truth Wall Street did not build America the middle class built America and unions built the middle class that's a fact by the way that is not a slogan that's a fact I asked the Treasury

Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Good afternoon Pittsburgh Applause Applause Thank you Joe Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause It is good to be in the House of Labor Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Now I don't have to tell the brothers and sisters of labor that you really get to know somebody when you're in the middle of a fight That's really great When times are hard When the forces are mighty When people don't believe something can get done and they have a thousand excuses for why it can't get done And I have spent more time with this extraordinary human being When the cameras were not in the room When the stakes were high When the heat was high When the heat was intense And Joe Biden has always stood with the workers of America and labor unions of America Always Always Applause Applause Applause I've been with him when he'll bring folks into the Oval Office and you know how Joe can get sometimes he doesn't spare words that sometimes the cameras are not in the room when he has those conversations Because the thing about the Joe Biden I know and I know you know because he has been a friend of labor for so long for his whole life Joe Biden can be quite impatient and that's a good thing for that kind of leader Quite impatient and I say to all of the friends here the press that's in the room history will show what we here know Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents in the United States that we have ever witnessed Applause Applause Applause And it comes from his heart Applause Applause Applause Applause And you know Joe and I talk a lot about the fact that we are so proud to be the most pro-Union administration in America's history Applause Applause Applause Applause And as we know Joe still got a lot of work to do so let's also understand that So I want to thank all the incredible leaders who are here today including the Governor Shapiro Lieutenant Governor Davis Senator Casey who we will re-elect this November Mayor Gaining President Scholar President Cooper all the leaders of labor who are here all the Union members who are here so I'll just get right to a few points I love Labor Day I love celebrating Labor Day And Pittsburgh of course is a cradle of the American Labor movement It is the birthplace of the AFL headquarters of the steel workers home to firefighters local one and of course the historic IBEW Local 5 Applause Applause Applause For more than 150 years the brothers and sisters of labor have helped lead the fight for fair pay better benefits and safe working conditions and every person in our nation has benefited from that work you know everywhere I go I tell people you may not be a union member but you better thank unions for that 5 day work week Applause Thank unions for sick leave Thank unions for pay family leave Applause Thank unions for your vacation time Applause Applause Because when union wages go up everybody's wages go up when union workplaces are safer all workplaces are safer when unions are strong America is strong Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause And we are clear not only has Pittsburgh shaped the history of America's labor movement today you are also shaping its future In 2021 with my dear friend the secretary Marty Walsh who the president appointed to be secretary of labor he and I hosted a meeting right here in this local and it was part of the White House Labor Task Force that I lead today we met with a group of computer programmers who were working to form a union one month later they signed their contract and became the first one of the first technology unions in our nation Applause Standing on the shoulder of all those who have been here and fought the good fight so Pittsburgh I remind us of that to say together we are fighting to build an economy that works for all working people Applause And that has always been the vision of the labor movement and that is the vision of our campaign you know in this election there are two very different visions for our nation one hours focused on the future the other focused on the past And the other focused on the future And the other focused on the future We fight for the future We fight for a future of dignity respect and opportunity for all people Applause Applause Applause We fight knowing it's some backward thinking for those folks who have been suggesting for years that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down You know that's the stuff they're pushing That the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down when we know the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up Applause Applause Who you lift up Applause Do you fight for workers? Do you fight for families? Do you fight for those who must be seen and heard and deserve the dignity that comes with hard work Applause That's what we fight for Applause And when you know what to stand for you know what to fight for Applause Applause So we're 64 days out from this election Laughter Laughter Ballots in Pennsylvania will start dropping in 14 days Applause 14 days Applause And this election is as much as anything else a fight for the promise of America Applause For the promise of America We love our country Applause And we know it is one of the highest forms of socialism to fight for the ideals of our country And that's what this election is about And about the promise of America And I don't need to tell unions what the promise looks like It's what you do every day Applause Applause Applause Applause But as we fight to move forward Donald Trump is trying to pull us backward Applause Including back to a time before workers had the freedom to organize Applause Well, the courts will handle that And we will handle November Applause Applause Applause We'll handle November, let the courts handle that Applause But we're not going back Applause Applause And one of the ways One of the ways we're going to guarantee we don't go back is that we remember Right? It is important to remember what that was and what it is Remember, as president Donald Trump blocked overtime benefits for millions of workers Applause He opposed efforts to raise the minimum wage Applause As the president said, he appointed union busters to the National Labor Relations Board Applause And don't forget, he supported so-called right to work laws Applause And if Donald Trump were to be re-elected he intends to give more tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations Applause He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare Applause He wants to impose what in effect would be a national sales tag I call it the Trump's national sales tag Applause On everyday products and basic necessities that would cost a typical American family the economist have said this Almost $4,000 a year Applause He intends to repeal the Affordable Care Act Applause And take us back to what we remember because it wasn't that long ago was a time when insurance companies could deny people pre-existing conditions Do you remember what that was? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors grandparents with diabetes Applause Well look America has tried those failed policies before and we are not going back Applause Applause Applause We are not going back Applause We are not going back Applause And instead we fight for a future where no person has to go broke just because they get sick Applause And so building on the work of President Joe Biden and I and the work we have done in the White House we will continue to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and make prescription drugs affordable for all Americans Applause We We fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to organize and we will pass the Pro Act Applause And end union busting once and for all and Bob Casey will help us do that Applause Applause Applause Applause We see and know and fight for a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead Applause And so we will continue to build what I call an opportunity economy so that every American has an opportunity to buy a home and start a business or build intergenerational wealth and have a future that matches their dreams and ambitions and aspirations Applause Because of course that's the nature of who we are as Americans We have dreams we can see what is possible unburdened by what has been We have aspirations We have ambitions and the system that is a good system is one that supports that and allows people the opportunity to go where they can see and imagine themselves to be That's what I'm talking about when I talk about an opportunity economy we fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity and so we will continue to defend Social Security and Medicare And pensions And pensions And pensions Applause And we will continue to strengthen America's manufacturing sector and on that point the President mentioned it U.S.",chunk_4,4712

2024-09-04,Event,"Harris held a campaign event in North Hampton, New Hampshire",full,"Hi guys, thank you all, thank you all, thank you it's so good to be back in New Hampshire, thank you all, thank you. And Doug Senses loved everyone as well. Oh, thank you everyone, Nicole, thank you, you guys are just so extraordinary and I applaud the way you do the business that you do and the love that you do in giving community. I love our small business owners. It is what you do. I'm going to talk a bit about you in a minute, but you are part of the fabric, the essential fabric of a community that cares about one another. Thank you for everything. Thank you, thank you. And thank you to the outstanding congressional delegation, Senators Shahid Hassan, Representatives Pappas and Custer, and all the leaders who are here today. Thank you all, thank you all for taking the time to be here this afternoon. Thank you everyone, thank you. So before I begin, I do want to say a few words about this tragic shooting that took place this morning in Winder, Georgia. We're still gathering information about what happened, but we know that there were multiple fatalities and injuries. And, you know, our hearts are with all the students, the teachers and their families, of course, and we are grateful to the first responders in the law enforcement that were on the scene, but this is just a senseless tragedy on top of so many senseless tragedies. And it's just outrageous that every day in our country in the United States of America that parents have to send their children to school worried about whether or not their child will come home alive. It's senseless. It is, we've got to stop it. And we have to end this epidemic of gun violence in our country once and for all. You know, it doesn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be this way. So we will continue, of course, to send our prayers and our thoughts to the families and all those who were affected, including, you know, I'm going off script right now, but listen. I mean, you know, at the last year, I started a college tour and I traveled our country meeting with our young leaders, right? And so it was college age young leaders. So I did trade schools, colleges, universities, community colleges. By the way, I love Gen Z. I just love Gen Z. But I'll tell you one of the things, one of the things that I asked every time I went to the auditorium, and it would be filled with these young leaders, students, and I'd ask them, raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade you had to endure an active shooter drill. And for the young leaders who are here who are raising their hand, I'm telling you, every time the auditorium was packed and almost every hand went up. You know, a lot of us, I'll speak about myself. You know, we had, well, I grew up in California, earthquake drills, we had fire drills, but our kids are sitting in a classroom where they should be fulfilling their God-given potential and some part of their big, beautiful brain is concerned about a shooter busting through the door of the classroom. It does not have to be this way. It does not have to be this way. And you know, this is one of the many issues that's at stake in this election. So New Hampshire, we have 62 days to go. 62 days to go. And I'm going to tell you what you already know, this race is going to be tight until the very end. So please, let's not pay too much attention to the polls because we are running as the underdog. We know what they're capable of on the other side. The only thing we can take for granted is the love that we as Americans have for each other, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. And we've got some hard work ahead. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work can be joyful work. And so we are up for the task. And with your help, we will win in November. We will win in November. And that in large part is because we know what we stand for. And when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. We love our country. And we believe in the promise of America. That's so much of what I think brings us all together this afternoon. And we believe in the promise of America. And that includes a topic we're going to discuss today, which is what I call an opportunity economy. Building an opportunity economy. And my vision of an opportunity economy is one where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed. Where everyone, regardless of who they are, where they start, can build wealth, including intergenerational wealth, where workers are treated with dignity and everyone has the freedom to join a union if they choose. Where we remove barriers to opportunity so anyone who wants to start a business can have access to the tools and the resources they need to do that. I believe, and I said it before in the call, I believe America's small businesses are an essential foundation to our entire economy. Think about it. Think about it. Small businesses in our country employ half of all private sector workers, half of all private sector workers, own or run a small business or work for a small business. They do trillions of dollars of business every year. They generate revenue that helps repair our roads and pay our teachers. And you know, for all of those who are or know of small business owners, the thing I love about you is that you're not only leaders in business, you are civic leaders. You are community leaders. You are mentors. You hire locally. You believe in the community and you're part of the glue of the fabric that holds communities together. You provide the local meeting space. You are the types of folks where you know who your regulars are and when someone's walking in the door and you can tell they've had a bad day, you know exactly what they need. Isn't that the best of who we are? Isn't that the best of who we are? And I've met so many entrepreneurs across the country who take the incredible leap of faith that is required to start a small business. Folks who put their life savings on the line and work through the weekends and holidays because they aren't just building a business, they're pursuing a dream. They're building a better future for their employees and for the people they love in their communities. And by extension, they're building a stronger middle class and a stronger America for us all. And so all of this is why as president, one of my highest priorities will be to strengthen America's small businesses. And here I am in New Hampshire to announce a few elements of my plan to do that. So first, we're going to help more small businesses and innovators get off the ground. Now I'm setting what some I'm sure are going to call a very ambitious goal, but you know what? I think we should admire ambition in each other. So I want to see 25 million new small business applications by the end of my first term. And to help achieve this, we will lower the cost of starting a new business. So here's the thing. On average, it costs about $40,000 to start a new business in America. That is a great financial barrier for a lot of folks and it can hold entrepreneurs back. And the current tax deduction for a startup is just $5,000. Okay? So then you got to make up the delta there. You got to figure out how you're going to do that. Not everyone has access to that kind of wealth and capital. So part of my plan is we will expand the tax deduction for startups to $50,000. It's essentially a tax cut for starting a small business. Second, my plan will help existing small businesses grow. We will provide low and no interest loans to small businesses that want to expand. And we will, and this is very important, cut the red tape that can make starting and growing a small business more accessible. More difficult than it needs to be. More difficult than it needs to be. For example, we will make it cheaper and easier for small businesses to file their taxes. Similar to how individuals can take a standard deduction. You know, I said to my team, kind of like, now I'm going to date myself again because they no longer do it, but kind of like you remember the 1040 EZ. Like that kind of idea, right? Like, let's just take away some of the bureaucracy in the process to make it easier for people to actually do something that's going to benefit our entire economy. Third, my plan will invest in small businesses and innovators throughout America. And here's why. We know that talent exists everywhere in our country, from rural towns to city centers. But not everyone has access to the financing to venture capital or expert advice. It's not that they don't have the skills. It's not that they don't have the work ethic. It's access to these resources. So under my plan, we will expand access to venture capital. We will support innovation hubs and business incubators. And we will increase federal contracts with small businesses. And we will have a particular focus on small businesses in rural communities, like right here in New Hampshire. Finally, my plan will make our tax code more fair while also prioritizing investment and innovation. So let us be clear. Billionaires and big corporations must pay their fair share in tax. Because here's the thing. Here's the thing. It's just not right that those who can most afford it are often paying a lower tax rate than our teachers and our nurses and our firefighters. It's just not right. It's just not right. So that's why I support a billionaire minimum tax and corporations paying their fair share. And while we ensure that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share, we will tax capital gains at a rate that rewards investment in America's innovators, founders, and small businesses. So here's the detail. If you earn a million dollars a year or more, the tax rate on your long-term capital gains will be 28% under my plan. Because we know when the government encourages investment, it leads to broad-based economic growth and it creates jobs which makes our economy stronger. Now compare that to what Donald Trump plans. He intends to cut off federal programs that give loans to small businesses. He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts and to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars even as they pull in record profits. His plans will add more than five trillion dollars to the national debt and that is on top of the two trillion dollar tax cut he gave them when he was president and when he exploded the deficit. We know how to count. We know how to count. And now he also wants to impose what in effect is a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities which will skyrocket the cost for families and small businesses. And New Hampshire on top of all of this, if Donald Trump were to win in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. Which would significantly increase costs on small businesses as we know. And well, you know what? The courts are going to handle that and we will handle November. How about that? How about that? That's how we'll handle that. How about that? But think about it. It wants to end the Affordable Care Act. Taking us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents, or diabetes? So, yeah, look, we are here to tell him and them we are not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. Not going back. Not going back. No, we are not. And we will move forward because ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. Now, I don't have to tell the folks of New Hampshire, the live, free, or die state. You know the importance of individual freedoms, fundamental freedoms. You know how hard people fought for these freedoms. And that they are foundational to who we are and what we stand for as America. Including the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. And understand how we got here. Understand how we got here. And of course we're not going to fall for the gas light and he's pushing, right? When he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. And now, in more than 20 states in our nation, there is a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral, immoral. And let us agree, and I know we do, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply help beliefs to agree. The government should not be telling her what to do with her body. And if he wins, and if he wins, you can be sure Donald Trump will go further. And he will sign a national abortion ban. And you know Project 2025, which I just, I mean, can you believe they put that thing in writing? And under Project 2025, he would create a national anti-abortion coordinator, which would force states, I mean this is unbelievable, right? Which would force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. You know what they are making really quite clear? They just don't trust women. They just don't trust women. But we trust women. We trust women. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Across our nation. Across our nation. Across our nation. And I've been traveling for many, many, well years actually, and certainly months most recently. Across our nation, I'm telling you, we are witnessing a full on attack on hard fought, hard won fundamental freedoms and rights. Including the freedom to vote. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water. And the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. And so here's what I don't have to tell the folks of New Hampshire, because you know it so well as part of your DNA. Generations of Americans before us, they fought for freedom and they led the fight for freedom in our country. And now, the baton is in our hands. The baton is in our hands. So let us understand which we do, our purpose at this very moment. Let us remember the broad shoulders upon which we stand and the traditions of this very fight that have led to what we have been able to accomplish. And let us understand then that when we say fight, it is a fight for something, not against something, it is for something. That's what we're talking about when we talk about a new way forward. This is for something. And so as an example, let us finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. Let us finally pass an assault weapons ban and universal background checks and red flag laws. Because we are clear on that point, it is a false choice to say you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away. I'm in favor of the Second Amendment and I know we need reasonable gun safety laws in our country. And there's another point that I'd like to stress about this election in 24. This is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher this time. For a number of reasons, but I'm going to mention one in particular, what the Supreme Court recently did. When they basically just told the former president that going forward, he will effectively be immune, no matter what he does in the White House. But let's take this seriously and understand what it means before at least there might have been the threat that there would be consequence and accountability. With that ruling, what this means is that almost explicitly he has been told no consequence. And imagine, just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Just imagine with no guardrails, he is openly vowed to be a dictator on day one. He has said he would end the independence of the Department of Justice, the United States Department of Justice. So he could have the unchecked power to seek vengeance against people who disagree with him. He even called, for I'm going to quote now, the termination of the Constitution of the United States of America. Let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States of America should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. So I'll end where I started. When it comes down to it, we are all here together because we love our country. We love our country and we know the privilege, the privilege and pride that comes with being an American. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we realize the promise of America. USA, USA, USA, USA. And so with that being said, I ask New Hampshire, are you ready to have your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.",full,3111

2024-09-04,Event,"Harris held a campaign event in North Hampton, New Hampshire",chunk,"And by extension, they're building a stronger middle class and a stronger America for us all. And so all of this is why as president, one of my highest priorities will be to strengthen America's small businesses. And here I am in New Hampshire to announce a few elements of my plan to do that. So first, we're going to help more small businesses and innovators get off the ground. Now I'm setting what some I'm sure are going to call a very ambitious goal, but you know what? I think we should admire ambition in each other. So I want to see 25 million new small business applications by the end of my first term. And to help achieve this, we will lower the cost of starting a new business. So here's the thing. On average, it costs about $40,000 to start a new business in America. That is a great financial barrier for a lot of folks and it can hold entrepreneurs back. And the current tax deduction for a startup is just $5,000. Okay? So then you got to make up the delta there. You got to figure out how you're going to do that. Not everyone has access to that kind of wealth and capital. So part of my plan is we will expand the tax deduction for startups to $50,000. It's essentially a tax cut for starting a small business. Second, my plan will help existing small businesses grow. We will provide low and no interest loans to small businesses that want to expand. And we will, and this is very important, cut the red tape that can make starting and growing a small business more accessible. More difficult than it needs to be. More difficult than it needs to be. For example, we will make it cheaper and easier for small businesses to file their taxes. Similar to how individuals can take a standard deduction. You know, I said to my team, kind of like, now I'm going to date myself again because they no longer do it, but kind of like you remember the 1040 EZ. Like that kind of idea, right? Like, let's just take away some of the bureaucracy in the process to make it easier for people to actually do something that's going to benefit our entire economy. Third, my plan will invest in small businesses and innovators throughout America.",chunk_4,400
2024-09-04,Event,"Harris held a campaign event in North Hampton, New Hampshire",chunk,"And here's why. We know that talent exists everywhere in our country, from rural towns to city centers. But not everyone has access to the financing to venture capital or expert advice. It's not that they don't have the skills. It's not that they don't have the work ethic. It's access to these resources. So under my plan, we will expand access to venture capital. We will support innovation hubs and business incubators. And we will increase federal contracts with small businesses. And we will have a particular focus on small businesses in rural communities, like right here in New Hampshire. Finally, my plan will make our tax code more fair while also prioritizing investment and innovation. So let us be clear. Billionaires and big corporations must pay their fair share in tax. Because here's the thing. Here's the thing. It's just not right that those who can most afford it are often paying a lower tax rate than our teachers and our nurses and our firefighters. It's just not right. It's just not right. So that's why I support a billionaire minimum tax and corporations paying their fair share. And while we ensure that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share, we will tax capital gains at a rate that rewards investment in America's innovators, founders, and small businesses. So here's the detail. If you earn a million dollars a year or more, the tax rate on your long-term capital gains will be 28% under my plan. Because we know when the government encourages investment, it leads to broad-based economic growth and it creates jobs which makes our economy stronger. Now compare that to what Donald Trump plans. He intends to cut off federal programs that give loans to small businesses. He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts and to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars even as they pull in record profits. His plans will add more than five trillion dollars to the national debt and that is on top of the two trillion dollar tax cut he gave them when he was president and when he exploded the deficit.",chunk_5,357
2024-09-04,Event,"Harris held a campaign event in North Hampton, New Hampshire",chunk,"We know how to count. We know how to count. And now he also wants to impose what in effect is a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities which will skyrocket the cost for families and small businesses. And New Hampshire on top of all of this, if Donald Trump were to win in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. Which would significantly increase costs on small businesses as we know. And well, you know what? The courts are going to handle that and we will handle November. How about that? How about that? That's how we'll handle that. How about that? But think about it. It wants to end the Affordable Care Act. Taking us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents, or diabetes? So, yeah, look, we are here to tell him and them we are not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. Not going back. Not going back. No, we are not. And we will move forward because ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. Now, I don't have to tell the folks of New Hampshire, the live, free, or die state. You know the importance of individual freedoms, fundamental freedoms. You know how hard people fought for these freedoms. And that they are foundational to who we are and what we stand for as America. Including the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. And understand how we got here. Understand how we got here. And of course we're not going to fall for the gas light and he's pushing, right? When he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. And now, in more than 20 states in our nation, there is a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral, immoral. And let us agree, and I know we do, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply help beliefs to agree.",chunk_6,391
2024-09-04,Event,"Harris held a campaign event in North Hampton, New Hampshire",chunk,"The government should not be telling her what to do with her body. And if he wins, and if he wins, you can be sure Donald Trump will go further. And he will sign a national abortion ban. And you know Project 2025, which I just, I mean, can you believe they put that thing in writing? And under Project 2025, he would create a national anti-abortion coordinator, which would force states, I mean this is unbelievable, right? Which would force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. You know what they are making really quite clear? They just don't trust women. They just don't trust women. But we trust women. We trust women. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Across our nation. Across our nation. Across our nation. And I've been traveling for many, many, well years actually, and certainly months most recently. Across our nation, I'm telling you, we are witnessing a full on attack on hard fought, hard won fundamental freedoms and rights. Including the freedom to vote. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water. And the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. And so here's what I don't have to tell the folks of New Hampshire, because you know it so well as part of your DNA. Generations of Americans before us, they fought for freedom and they led the fight for freedom in our country. And now, the baton is in our hands. The baton is in our hands. So let us understand which we do, our purpose at this very moment. Let us remember the broad shoulders upon which we stand and the traditions of this very fight that have led to what we have been able to accomplish. And let us understand then that when we say fight, it is a fight for something, not against something, it is for something. That's what we're talking about when we talk about a new way forward. This is for something. And so as an example, let us finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.",chunk_7,379
2024-09-04,Event,"Harris held a campaign event in North Hampton, New Hampshire",chunk,"Let us finally pass an assault weapons ban and universal background checks and red flag laws. Because we are clear on that point, it is a false choice to say you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away. I'm in favor of the Second Amendment and I know we need reasonable gun safety laws in our country. And there's another point that I'd like to stress about this election in 24. This is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher this time. For a number of reasons, but I'm going to mention one in particular, what the Supreme Court recently did. When they basically just told the former president that going forward, he will effectively be immune, no matter what he does in the White House. But let's take this seriously and understand what it means before at least there might have been the threat that there would be consequence and accountability. With that ruling, what this means is that almost explicitly he has been told no consequence. And imagine, just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Just imagine with no guardrails, he is openly vowed to be a dictator on day one. He has said he would end the independence of the Department of Justice, the United States Department of Justice. So he could have the unchecked power to seek vengeance against people who disagree with him. He even called, for I'm going to quote now, the termination of the Constitution of the United States of America. Let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States of America should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. So I'll end where I started. When it comes down to it, we are all here together because we love our country. We love our country and we know the privilege, the privilege and pride that comes with being an American. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we realize the promise of America. USA, USA, USA, USA.",chunk_8,368

2024-09-12,Rally,"Harris held rallies in Greensboro, North Carolina",full,"Good evening, Greensboro! My name is Jasmine Ross, and as a proud Vida Bell, I am so excited to welcome you all to our great city today. And I am incredibly honored to welcome Vice President Harris to Greensboro for her night visit to the Torre Hill State. This November, I am proud to be a first-time voter. And when I go to that voting booth, I will remember that Vice President Harris and Governor Roth is the only candidate on that ballot who are fighting for a new way forward. Who will be a president for all Reconlinians. And that Donald Trump is only fighting for himself. I remember that she is fighting for young people like me to have an opportunity not to just get by, but to get ahead. I remember her tireless leadership in investing in HBCUs like Bennett College, delivering a historic $16 billion in our HBCUs across the country. Because she knows our HBCUs are centers of academic excellence. I remember she chose us women to make decisions for their own bodies and their futures. And the same cannot be said about Donald Trump. Donald Trump made it clear again this week that he wants to rip away our fundamental freedoms and he thinks he knows better than women. And he'll raise our costs to cut taxes for his witch friends. Donald Trump wants to take us back. But here's the thing, young voters know North Carolina is not going back. Young people like me are looking for leaders who will take us forward, not backwards. Electing Vice President Harris as president of the United States is the best thing we could do to protect our rights, secure our democracy, and ensure folks have the opportunity to not just get by, but get ahead. We know that the path to the White House runs through North Carolina and we are up for the challenge. Now, please join me in welcoming our guest of honor, Vice President Kamala Harris. Good evening North Carolina. I'll tell you when I hear our young leaders such as Jasmine, I know the future of our country is so bright, so bright, so bright. And it is so good to be back in Greensboro and to be with so many leaders. Thank you everybody. Thank you. I want to thank the incredible Governor Roy Cooper. Thank you. Your next Governor, Attorney General Joss Stein, Representative Manning, Mayor Vaughan, the council of state candidates, and all the leaders with us today. So North Carolina, two nights ago, Donald Trump and I had our debates. You watched it? And look, I believe we owe it to have another debate. We owe it to the voters. Because here's the thing, in this election, what's at stake could not be more important. On Tuesday night, I talked about issues that I know matter to the families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom, and keeping our nation safe and secure. But that's not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, you know, and I called it at the beginning of the debate, it was the same old show. Same old tired playbook we've heard for years with no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people. Well, folks, look, it's time to turn the page. America is ready for a new way forward, and we are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do for our country together. And that is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are all supporting our campaign. Because we agree, we agree we have a duty as citizens to put country above partisanship and defend our Constitution. And defend our Constitution. And that is my pledge to you. I will always put country above party, from the courthouse to the White House. I have always fought for the people. I have always fought for the people. From being a young courtroom prosecutor, yes, USA, come on. From being a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California, I stood up for women and children against predators who abuse them. As Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. I stood up for veterans being scammed by big-for-profit colleges, for workers who were being cheated out of their wages, the wages there were due, for seniors facing elder abuse. I will be a president for all Americans. And together, together we will build a brighter future for our nation. All right, nuke. We are going to build a future where we build what I call an opportunity economy. So every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business. And let me tell you, I love our small business. Are there small business leaders here? Raise your hand. That's right. So, you know, growing up, growing up, my mother, she worked long hours. She often worked very long hours, my mother. And so my sister, Maya, and I, would go over to Ms. Shelton's house. Now, Ms. Shelton, we called her our second mother. She was the second mother to us. She actually was from Louisiana, and she would take care of us in the evenings and on the weekends when my mother was working. And she was a small business owner. And let me tell you what I learned from being a young child about a small business owner, Ms. Shelton. Our small business owners, you are business leaders, and you are civic leaders. You are community leaders. You hire locally. You mentor. You are part of the fabric of our communities. And you, like Ms. Shelton, are the backbone of America's economy. The backbone. So I have a plan for you, and my plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction for startup businesses. Because I understand not everybody like the person that was on the stage with me the other night gets handed $400 million on a silver platter and then flies a bankruptcy six times. Come on. Come on. I know what, look, my mother, she worked hard. She saved up, and it wasn't until I was a teenager she was able to buy our first home. I know the challenges that Americans and working people and families are having right now in terms of affordable housing. And we need to build more housing in America. So part of my plan, part of my vision for an opportunity economy is we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term. And I have a plan to lower the cost of living for America's families on everything from health care to groceries, including taking on price gouging and those corporations when they take advantage of people in need. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut. Thousands of dollars of your hard earned money will go back in your pockets, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life for young parents. Knowing in that critical stage of your child's development, you might need a little help, not just to get by, but to get ahead. And I will always put the middle class and working families first. I know where I came from. I know where I came from. I'm clear about that. Now, Donald Trump, well, he has a different plan. Just Google Project 2025. I see you have. It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires massive cuts, massive tax cuts, and cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars, even as they pull down record profits. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. And he wants to impose what I call a Trump sales tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average American family nearly $4,000 a year. Some of the top economists in our country and in the world have reviewed these plans. Goldman Sachs, for example, had said that my plan would grow our economy and his plan would shrink the economy. That his plan would reignite inflation and send us into a recession by the middle of next year. On top of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. Now think about that. Think about that. Think of we remember what it meant when insurance companies could deny you for a pre-existing condition. Remember what that was? So he wants to get rid of it. And as he said in the debate, he made clear he has no plan to replace it. In fact, you remember? Concept. You remember. He has quote, concepts of a plan. Concepts of a plan. I mean, we're 54 days from the selection. Concepts of a plan. Which means no actual plan. Which means no actual plan. And 45 million Americans are insured through the Affordable Care Act. So understand what that means. He's going to end it based on a concept and take us back when folks were suffering. Well, we're not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. No, we, we together will move forward because ours is a fight for the future. And, and ours is a fight for freedom. And I like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court. And they did exactly as he intended. And now more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban, including North Carolina. And every single state in the South except Virginia. Many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. It is immoral, immoral. And I know everyone here understands. Let us agree. One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree. The government should not be telling her what to do with her body. Come on. Come on. And when, and when he was asked on Tuesday night, Donald Trump refused to say that he would veto a national abortion ban. Well, well, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. We are not playing around. And across our nation, we are witnessing a full on attack on hard fought, hard won fundamental rights and freedoms. Like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. And here's the thing that I know about all of the North Carolinian leaders who are here. You know this so well as part of your DNA. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Generations of Americans before us, many from right here, led the fight for freedom. Let's get a medic. Let's get a medic. Do we have a medic? Let's get a medic over there, please. Let's get a medic over there. Yeah, but let's make sure. See, see, this is who we are. We look out for each other. That's what leaders do, looking out for each other. Okay, we've got a medic. So generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom and now the baton is in our hands. The baton is now in our hands. And we who believe then in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. And we who believe in the freedom to live safe and gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and red flag laws. So much is on the line in this election. And we got this. But look, but look, here's the thing. This is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher. Because two months ago, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. Well, well, well, here's the thing. The courts will take care of that. Let's take care of November. How about that? All right. But imagine, imagine what that court ruling means. Imagine what that means because before there might have been at least the belief that there would be the threat of consequence. But now there's an explicit ruling from the court that suggests he would be immune. Imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Imagine what that would look like. He who has vowed if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one. He who called for the termination of the Constitution of the United States. And let us be very clear. Someone who suggests that we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. Never again. Never again. Never. Never again. And put that all in the context of people who have been talking about how he was when they served with him in the White House. People who saw him every day. His national security advisor. His defense secretary. His chief of staff. And his vice president. All of whom have warned America Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States. And to never occupy our nation's highest office again. So North Carolina, I believe it all comes down to this. We are here together. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And we together understand the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth. The privilege and pride of being an American. It's an awesome responsibility. That's right. That's right. That's right. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. And so North Carolina, we have 54 days until election day. 54 days until election day. And just 35 days until early voting begins. And it's not only the presidency that's on the ballot. There are many, many important races like Josh Stein running for governor. Who's opponent was handpicked by Donald Trump because he wants a total ban on abortion in this state. And that is just one of the many stakes that are at play in this election. But see, we know the power is with the people. The power is with the people. Your voice is your boat, North Carolina. And you are going to make all the difference in the outcome of this race. And look, we know ours will be a very tight race until the very end. We are the underdog. Let's be clear about that. We are the underdog. And so we have hard work ahead of us, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. And with your help, we will win. We will win. And so I ask you today, North Carolina, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. There you go. God bless you and God bless America. God bless America. God bless America. Thank you.",full,2623

I mean, we're 54 days from the selection. Concepts of a plan. Which means no actual plan. Which means no actual plan. And 45 million Americans are insured through the Affordable Care Act. So understand what that means. He's going to end it based on a concept and take us back when folks were suffering.",chunk_4,380
2024-09-12,Rally,"Harris held rallies in Greensboro, North Carolina",chunk,"Well, we're not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. No, we, we together will move forward because ours is a fight for the future. And, and ours is a fight for freedom. And I like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court. And they did exactly as he intended. And now more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban, including North Carolina. And every single state in the South except Virginia. Many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. It is immoral, immoral. And I know everyone here understands. Let us agree. One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree. The government should not be telling her what to do with her body. Come on. Come on. And when, and when he was asked on Tuesday night, Donald Trump refused to say that he would veto a national abortion ban. Well, well, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. We are not playing around. And across our nation, we are witnessing a full on attack on hard fought, hard won fundamental rights and freedoms. Like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. And here's the thing that I know about all of the North Carolinian leaders who are here. You know this so well as part of your DNA. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Generations of Americans before us, many from right here, led the fight for freedom. Let's get a medic. Let's get a medic. Do we have a medic? Let's get a medic over there, please. Let's get a medic over there. Yeah, but let's make sure. See, see, this is who we are. We look out for each other. That's what leaders do, looking out for each other. Okay, we've got a medic.",chunk_5,385
2024-09-12,Rally,"Harris held rallies in Greensboro, North Carolina",chunk,"So generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom and now the baton is in our hands. The baton is now in our hands. And we who believe then in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. And we who believe in the freedom to live safe and gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and red flag laws. So much is on the line in this election. And we got this. But look, but look, here's the thing. This is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher. Because two months ago, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. Well, well, well, here's the thing. The courts will take care of that. Let's take care of November. How about that? All right. But imagine, imagine what that court ruling means. Imagine what that means because before there might have been at least the belief that there would be the threat of consequence. But now there's an explicit ruling from the court that suggests he would be immune. Imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Imagine what that would look like. He who has vowed if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one. He who called for the termination of the Constitution of the United States. And let us be very clear. Someone who suggests that we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. Never again. Never again. Never. Never again. And put that all in the context of people who have been talking about how he was when they served with him in the White House. People who saw him every day. His national security advisor. His defense secretary. His chief of staff. And his vice president. All of whom have warned America Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States. And to never occupy our nation's highest office again. So North Carolina, I believe it all comes down to this.",chunk_6,371
2024-09-12,Rally,"Harris held rallies in Greensboro, North Carolina",chunk,"We are here together. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And we together understand the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth. The privilege and pride of being an American. It's an awesome responsibility. That's right. That's right. That's right. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. And so North Carolina, we have 54 days until election day. 54 days until election day. And just 35 days until early voting begins. And it's not only the presidency that's on the ballot. There are many, many important races like Josh Stein running for governor. Who's opponent was handpicked by Donald Trump because he wants a total ban on abortion in this state. And that is just one of the many stakes that are at play in this election. But see, we know the power is with the people. The power is with the people. Your voice is your boat, North Carolina. And you are going to make all the difference in the outcome of this race. And look, we know ours will be a very tight race until the very end. We are the underdog. Let's be clear about that. We are the underdog. And so we have hard work ahead of us, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. And with your help, we will win. We will win. And so I ask you today, North Carolina, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. There you go. God bless you and God bless America. God bless America. God bless America. Thank you.",chunk_7,324

2024-09-13,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania",full,"Good evening. Can we please hear it for Mary Grace? It's good to be back in person, baby. Hi, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay. We got some business to handle. Okay. So let me start by saying to everyone here, thank you for all you are doing and for taking the time to be here this evening. You know, one of the things that I love about everyone who is here and what we are doing, you know, in the midst of this moment where there are people trying to divide us as a nation, trying to make people feel small and feel alone, these are moments that remind all of us that we are all in this together as one loving family. Thank you all for the time you've taken to be here this evening. I want to thank also all the incredible leaders including Governor Shapiro, Senator Bob Casey, who we will re-elect to the United States Senate, and Mayor Brown. Thank you, Mayor, for the warm welcome. All right. So, Pennsylvania, three days ago, Donald Trump and I had our debate. You watched it. So, yeah. So here's the thing. So I take it many people here watched it. So you'll remember that night I talked about issues that mattered to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom, and keeping our nation safe and secure. But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show, the same tired playbook we've heard for years with no plan, no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. So folks, it's time to turn the page. Turn the page. We're not going back. We're not going back. And we are not going back because we're not going back because America is ready for a new way forward. We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together. Which is why, and Mary Grace, thank you, which is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign. We need a president of the United States who works for all the American people. And that just stops with all the trying to divide us. People are exhausted with that stuff. Exhausted. And you know, my entire career, I have fought for the people. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators who abuse them. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion from middle class families who faced foreclosure. I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for profit colleges. I stood up for workers who are being cheated out of the wages they were due for seniors facing elder abuse. And as attorney general of a border state, I took on transnational criminal organizations like the Sinaloa Cartel that traffic in drugs and threaten the safety of our communities. I know these cartels firsthand and as president, I will make sure we prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law for pushing poison like fentanyl on our children. And as president, I will fight on behalf of all communities and all Americans. And together, we will build a brighter future for our nation. Together. Together. And we. And that future and that future we build will include what I call an opportunity economy so that every American has an opportunity to own a home to build wealth and to start a business. You know, I love our small businesses. So growing up, I really do. We have small business leaders here. Raise your hand. Yeah, right. So growing up, my sister and my mother, my sister and me had a mother have a mother had a mother. Excuse me. She passed. But our mother worked long hours. She worked hard. She worked long hours. And my sister, Maya and I would go over to Miss Shelton's house. And she helped my mother take care of us. And we, in fact, used to call her our second mother. Well, Miss Shelton was a small business owner. And I will tell you, since I was a child, I know the character and the person who is a small business owner. You're not only business leaders, you're civic leaders. You hold the community together. You're part of the fabric of the community. And small business owners are the backbone of America's economy. The backbone of America's economy. Which is why part of my plan that you heard about the other night will give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses. Knowing that not everybody, like my opponent, got handed $40 million on a silver tray and then filed for bankruptcy six times. And people sometimes just need the opportunity because we as Americans do not lack for ambition, for aspiration, for dreams, for the preparedness to do hard work. But not everyone has the opportunity because not everyone has the access. When I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is grounded in that foundational belief that when given an opportunity, people excel every day. Every day. Part of my focus is on the fact that we need to build more housing in America. And so we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build three million new homes by the end of my first turn. And I have a plan to help lower the cost of living for America's families on everything from healthcare to groceries, including I will take on corporate price gouging, which as we know is about those few bad guys taking advantage of desperate people and there needs to be a consequence. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut, including expanding the child tax credit to $6,000 during the first year of a child's life, understanding that new parents need support in that most critical phase of their child's development to help them. By a car seat, a crib, baby clothes, I will also make sure good paying jobs are available to all Americans, not just those with college degrees. For far too long, our nation has encouraged only one path to success, a four year college degree. Our nation needs to recognize the value of other paths, additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs. So as president, I will get rid of the unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs to increase jobs for folks without a four year degree understanding that requiring a certain degree does not necessarily talk about one's skills. And I will challenge the private sector to do the same. All of this to say, look, I come from the middle class, I understand where I come from and I'm never going to forget that. And I will always put middle class working people first. It will always be my priority. Always be my priority. I know where I come from. I know where I come from. But now Donald Trump has a different plan. Just Google, just, just look up the Google. Just Google project 2025. It is a detailed, dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he were elected president again. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts like he did before. He intends to cut social security and Medicare. And he wants to impose what I call the Trump sales tax on everyday basic necessities, which as economists have reviewed would cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year. But independent economists like Goldman Sachs have said my plan would grow our economy and his plan would shrink the economy, reignite inflation and send us into a recession by the middle of next year. On top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And let's remember, like when I hear with Trump amnesia, we remember, remember when he was president, he tried 60 times to end the Affordable Care Act. And as he said in the debate just this week, he has no plan to replace it. Right, right, you said it. He said he has quote, concepts of a plan. Concepts of a plan. No actual plan. So let's just think about this for a moment. He's going to threaten health insurance for the 45 million people who rely on it based on a concept. And take us back when insurance companies have, but because we remember where that was. We remember what that was when insurance companies have the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. Remember what that was like. Remember. Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. No. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back.

2024-09-13,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania",chunk,"Good evening. Can we please hear it for Mary Grace? It's good to be back in person, baby. Hi, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay. We got some business to handle. Okay. So let me start by saying to everyone here, thank you for all you are doing and for taking the time to be here this evening. You know, one of the things that I love about everyone who is here and what we are doing, you know, in the midst of this moment where there are people trying to divide us as a nation, trying to make people feel small and feel alone, these are moments that remind all of us that we are all in this together as one loving family. Thank you all for the time you've taken to be here this evening. I want to thank also all the incredible leaders including Governor Shapiro, Senator Bob Casey, who we will re-elect to the United States Senate, and Mayor Brown. Thank you, Mayor, for the warm welcome. All right. So, Pennsylvania, three days ago, Donald Trump and I had our debate. You watched it. So, yeah. So here's the thing. So I take it many people here watched it. So you'll remember that night I talked about issues that mattered to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom, and keeping our nation safe and secure. But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show, the same tired playbook we've heard for years with no plan, no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. So folks, it's time to turn the page. Turn the page. We're not going back. We're not going back. And we are not going back because we're not going back because America is ready for a new way forward. We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together.

2024-09-13,Interview,"Harris participated in an interview with WPVI-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",full,"All good? Okay. Okay, wonderful. Good. Awesome. Madam Vice President, pleasure to meet you. Thanks for your time today. It's me, too. Our audience appreciates your time. Of course. As you know, we're sitting here in a state and arguably in front of an audience that 54 days from now could decide the outcome of this presidential election. You hear it more than I do. People want to know more about you and about your specific plans. At the debate the other night, you talked about creating an opportunity economy. I wonder if we can drill down on that a little bit. When we talk about bringing down prices and making life more affordable for people, what are one or two specific things you have in mind for that? Well, I'll start with this. I grew up a middle-class kid. My mother raised my sister and me. She worked very hard. She was able to finally save up enough money to buy our first house when I was a teenager. I grew up in a community of hardworking people, you know, construction workers and nurses and teachers. I try to explain to some people who may not have had the same experience, you know, but a lot of people will relate to this. I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn, you know? And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity. And that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions. So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business. My mother, you know, worked long hours and our neighbor helped raise us. We used to call her, I still call her our second mother. She was a small business owner. I love our small business owners. I learned who they are from my childhood. And she was a community leader. She hired locally. She mentored. Our small businesses are so much a part of the fabric of our communities, not to mention really I think the backbone of America's economy. So my opportunity economy plan includes giving startups a $50,000 tax deduction to start their small business. It used to be $5,000. Nobody can start a small business with $5,000, but investing in people's innovative ideas and giving them the ability to go for it. Opportunity economy means, look, we don't have housing in America. We have a housing supply shortage. And what that means, in particular for so many younger Americans, the American dream is elusive. It's just actually not attainable. So part of my plan is to work with the private sector and housing developers to give them a tax credit, to be able to partner with us as the government, to build in my goal is three million new homes by the end of my first term, in addition to help people who just want to get their foot in the door literally. And so giving first time home buyers a $25,000 down payment assistance to be able to just get in the door and then they will do the work that they need to do to save and to pay that mortgage and to build wealth for themselves and their family. These are some examples of what I mean when I talk about an opportunity economy and a lot of it has to do with just the community I was raised in and the people that I admired who work hard and deserve to have their dreams fulfilled because they're prepared to work for it. You talk at the debate and at previous appearances about turning the page on the past and in fact here today in Johnstown you're talking about a new way forward. I think some people have a question given maybe your current role as vice president of the United States. How different you are from Joe Biden and so I wonder if there are one or two spots, policy areas or approaches where you would say I'm a different person. Well I'm obviously not Joe Biden and you know I offer a new generation of leadership and so for example thinking about developing and creating an opportunity economy where it's about investing in areas that really need a lot of work and maybe focusing on again the aspirations and the dreams but also just recognizing that at this moment in time some of the stuff we could take for granted years ago we can't take for granted anymore. For example another plan that I have that is a new approach is to expand the child tax credit to $6,000 for young families for the first year of their child's life because that is obviously a very critical stage of development of a child and a lot of young parents need the help to buy a car seat or a crib or clothes for their kids and so my approach is about new ideas, new policies that are directed at the current moment and also to be very honest with you my focus is very much in what we need to do over the next 10, 20 years to catch up to the 21st century around again capacity but also challenges. Crime and public safety are two major issues right at the forefront of voters' minds. In Philadelphia as well where crime is a significant issue when we talk about crime the conversation turns to gun safety as well and I think you actually probably caught a lot of people off guard maybe a bit by surprise in the debate the other night when you mentioned that you are a gun owner I know you said it in 2019 as well. We're talking about your values on this issue when it comes to gun ownership where do you draw the line in America on gun ownership and gun use? Well like you said Brian I am a gun owner and Tim Walls my running mate is also a gun owner we're not taking anybody's guns away. I support the Second Amendment and I support reasonable gun safety laws. Part of my approach to this is I was a career prosecutor for most of my career I have personally prosecuted homicide cases. I have personally looked at autopsies. I have personally seen what assault weapons do to the human body and so I feel very strongly that it is consistent with the Second Amendment and your right to own a gun to also say we need an assault weapons ban they're literally tools of war they were literally designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly I say we need universal background checks the majority of NRA members support that why because it's just reasonable you just might want to know before someone can buy a lethal weapon if they've been found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others you just might want to know. Two final questions if I might. On the appeal of the man you were running against you drove here today you likely saw a lot of Trump signs he has an historic appeal in this country and as you are someone running against him and trying to understand that I wonder how you distill it what do you understand his appeal to be and how do you speak to his voters or maybe people who just share his values but are open to something else. I based on experience and and a lived experience no in my heart I know in my soul I know that the vast majority of us as Americans have so much more in common and what separates us and I also believe that I am accurate in knowing that most Americans want a leader who brings us together as Americans and not someone who professes to be a leader who is trying to have us point our fingers at each other. I think people are exhausted with that approach to be honest with you I think people want a leader who has common sense and tries to find common ground I'm supported by over 200 Republicans who worked for both presidents Bush John McCain Mitt Romney I'm supported by the former vice president Dick Cheney congress former congress member Liz Cheney and I think people are more willing now in light of the the hate and division that we see coming out of Donald Trump to say hey let's let's put country first and I think that just makes us stronger and more healthy as a country to say look we will we can all debate our differences around you know various policies but let's stop with the division like enough of that let's bring everybody together and finally as you introduce yourself to America in a new way they've heard much of your story at the Democratic National Convention in in that debate earlier this week if there's one thing that you wish Americans knew about who Kamala Harris is that you don't think they know yet what would that be I don't know I've been probably it's not very different from anybody watching right now I love my family um one of my favorite things that I lately have not been able to do a Sunday family dinner I love to cook I I have incredible friends my best friend from kindergarten is still my best friend I think that I mean I have a career that really and I said it the other day you know as a career prosecutor I never asked a victim of crime were they a republican or a democrat the only thing I ever asked them is are you okay and I think that's the approach that most Americans want regardless of who they voted for in the last election in terms of turning the page and turning the way forward I imagine looking forward to cooking Sunday dinner again I am looking for it I'd love I yes I am looking forward to cooking with the whole family gets involved the kids each have their role yeah well it's a beautiful family and we thank you for your time pleasure meeting you thank you Brian thank you all thank you guys yeah",full,1777

2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",full,"whether or not voters are better off now than they were four years ago. Are they better off now than they were four years ago? So when we came into, well first of all, let me just say it is good to be with the National Association of Black Journalists and I thank you for the work you do and that your members do every day. It is very important that we ensure that this organization and your members always have the resources and the platforms to deliver the voices that must be heard. So I thank you for hosting me today. Four years ago when we came in, we came in during the worst unemployment since the Great Depression. We came in during the worst public health epidemic in centuries. We came in after the worst attack on our democracies since the Civil War. And a lot of it do in large part to the mismanagement by the former president as it relates to COVID and obviously January 6th. And we had then a lot of work to do to clean up a mess. As of today, we have created over 16 million new jobs, over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. We have the lowest black unemployment rate in generations. We have invested in small businesses and they're to the benefit of many people, but including black small businesses, some of the highest rate of creation of new black small businesses in years. We have done the work of capping the cost of prescription medication for our seniors for issues like insulin. And again, I'm speaking to the black journalists who care about all people, but in particular, I'll talk about the impact on black people where we know black folks are 60 times more likely, 60%, excuse me, more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. And we have now finally capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month, capped the cost of prescription medication for our seniors at $2,000 a year because we, unlike the former president who promised to do it, we finally have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices against the big pharmaceutical companies. And these are just some of the accomplishments. Is the price of grocery still too high? Yes. Do we have more work to do? Yes. And I will tell you, I do believe that I offer a new generation of leadership for our country that is about, in particular, turning the page on an era that sadly has shown us attempts by some to incite fear to create division in our country and to do the work that is about bringing some level of optimism and, dare I say, ambition about what I know is possible in our country. And so my plan for the economy includes what I imagine and believe and call an opportunity economy, what we can do to grow an opportunity economy where all people have access to the resources to compete to apply their incredible work ethic, their ambition, their aspirations and their dreams and actually not just get by but get ahead. And I can talk in more detail about it, but specifically I'll mention a few things. Yeah. One of the big issues that affects people right now in terms of the economy and their economic wellbeing is we have a shortage of housing supply. It's too expensive, people can't afford to buy a home. You know, we grew up, our parents, where they had the ability to somehow believe the American dream was attainable. Not so much for younger working people. And I recognize that. So my approach is a new approach which is to say, let's just take this and deal with it head on. And part of my approach is to say, I'm gonna employ and engage the private sector, in particular home builders with tax credits to give them the incentive to create new housing, three million by the end of my first term and understanding that not everybody is handed a silver spoon but works hard and is trying to save up for a down payment. Part of my plan under my opportunity economy is to give first time home buyers a $25,000 down payment assistance so they can just get their foot in the door to be able to then engage in what will prove to be their opportunity to build intergenerational wealth. And here's my personal experience coming at that. I grew up a middle class kid. My mother was hard working, she raised me and my sister, Maya. She saved up and it was only by the time I was a teenager that she could afford to actually buy her first home. And I know, and I identify with, I know where I come from. Madam Vice President. And I know, but I'm just gonna finish. I know that so many people work so hard and should have the opportunity to just get their foot in the door. Again, so it's not just about getting by but getting ahead, please. I'd like to ask you more about the opportunity economy. Housing is a part of it, as well as expanding the earned income tax credit, financial support, as you mentioned, for first time buyers and a $50,000 tax deduction for startups and small businesses. But I wanna talk to you about the squeeze that millions of Americans are also dealing with that impacts their ability to work and make money. And that is childcare and elder care. And it's a squeeze for millions of people. In some parts of the country, it costs more for childcare than for rents. I think Rumberg recently reported an average of $33,000 a year. So I'm just wondering, you mentioned that in your opportunity economy, a child tax credit, but that's just one part of an ecosystem. Please tell us what plans will you propose to guarantee that families can actually afford childcare and elder care? So to your point, it is sadly the state of affairs in our country that working people often have to decide to either be able to work or be able to afford childcare. Like they can't afford childcare and actually do the work that they want to do because it's too expensive and it doesn't actually level out in terms of the expense versus the income. My plan is that no family, no working family should pay more than 7% of their income in childcare. Because I know that when you talk about the return on that investment, allowing people to work, allowing people to pursue their dreams in terms of how they want to work, where they want to work, benefits us all. It's strengthened the entire economy. We saw, for example, during the pandemic, what happened? And it sadly has dissipated as a conversation that we need to resuscitate, which is the number of women that had to leave the workforce because of the lack of childcare and home healthcare and so many of our families, and particularly women end up carrying the responsibility, men do too, of course, what we call people who are in the sandwich generation. Exactly. Who have young children and are also taking care of their parents. And it is just absolutely too expensive for them to be able to work and do that. So my plan is not only about 7% of income for working people for childcare, but also we need to do better for our childcare providers and our home healthcare providers in terms of ensuring that they receive the wages that they deserve based on the dignity of their work. I have spent time with home healthcare providers. And their work is some of the most taxing work you can imagine. And I actually, when my mother was sick with cancer, did a lot in terms of taking care of her. And the work that is about taking care of a loved one in particular, an elder, is extraordinarily heavy in terms of the emotional toll, the time it takes, and we do it, because that is what we do, but not everyone has the ability to take time from work to do it, and they need help. And we need to make sure we have home healthcare workers that can help them. But I want to also get back to the earlier point that you made about extending the child tax credit. So part of my new approach is we need to expand the child tax credit. And so part of my plan that is under an opportunity economy is to extend and expand the child tax credit to $6,000. So that young families in particular, for the first year of their child's life, which is an extraordinarily important time in their development, have the resources to be able to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy children's clothing, and not have to worry about whether they're gonna be able to meet their other needs. And I don't need to remind anybody here, especially these esteemed journalists, but when we expanded the child tax credit a couple years ago, we reduced black child poverty by half. And so again, if you talk about the benefit, and if you think about the benefit, to the economy overall, it strengthens our economy to do things like pay attention to affordable childcare, affordable home health care, and extending the child tax credit. Madam Vice President, black men, as you know, are a closely watch voting bloc. You've hosted black men at your residence. You have engaged black men and centered them in your economic opportunity tour. But polling shows that some black men, particularly young black men, are considering voting for Donald Trump, and they see him as better for the economy. What is your message to young black male voters who feel left out of this economy, and how can your economic policies materially change their lives? So I appreciate the spirit of the question, but I'll tell you, I've often been asked this question in a way that I've had to respond by first saying, that I think it's very important to not operate from the assumption that black men are in anybody's pocket. Black men are like any other voting group. You gotta earn their vote. So I'm working to earn the vote, not assuming I'm going to have it because I am black, but because the policies and the perspectives I have understands what we must do to recognize the needs of all communities. And I intend to be a president for all people, specifically as it relates to what we need to do, to your point, around economic opportunity. Yes, I started way before I was at the top of the ticket, at what I called an economic opportunity tour, focused on black men. Understanding that, for example, we have so many entrepreneurs in the community who do not have access to capital, but they've got great ideas, an incredible work ethic, the ambition, the aspiration, the dream, but don't have the relationships necessarily. So my work has included, as vice president, getting billions more dollars into community banks, including working with the big banks to do that, so that we can increase access to capital for our small businesses, for our startups. Part of my plan under my economic opportunity plan going forward is that right now, startup entrepreneurs, small businesses, only get a tax deduction of $5,000. Nobody can start a small business with $5,000. So I'm expanding that to $50,000. Understanding, again, that when people have the opportunity to have the resources to get started, they're gonna put the good ideas, they're gonna put the hard work into it. And part of what I also know is that our young black men, our black men, just like any group of people, anybody, our small businesses are really the backbone of our economy overall, and when they do better economically, we all do better. Part of my work is about understanding what we need to do in dealing with, for example, the historic inequities that have faced the black community around home ownership. I don't have to go through the history with anybody here about what that has meant in terms of redlining, what that has meant in terms of biases in home appraisals, and what the impact it has had on stemming the opportunity to build intergenerational wealth because of those obstacles. So part of the work that I have done and will continue to do is identify, speak truth about those obstacles and address them. Another example is medical debt. One in four black families or individuals is more likely to carry medical debt than others. So part of my perspective and as vice president, part of the work that we have done is to say that we're gonna eliminate medical debt from being on your credit score because until now, medical debt worked against your credit score and people know their credit score, like you wait, you know that number. And the difference between what that number is and what it needs to be is the difference between you being able to get a car loan, a small business loan, or even a lease on an apartment. And so part of my approach is understanding the obstacles that traditionally and currently exist to allow anyone, including black men, be able to achieve economic wealth. And I'm gonna tell you, I don't think it is sufficient to just only talk about economic policy around reducing unemployment. It is an important marker. And I'm proud of the work that we've done thus far, but it should be a baseline there, everybody's working. The point is, do people have an opportunity to build wealth? If that's what they choose to do, if that's what they want to do. And a lot of my perspective as we go forward is just that. I believe that there are a lot of opportunities that are available to the American people if we just see people and understand what they want for themselves and their families and then meet them where they are. Madam Vice President, I wanna switch gears a little bit and talk about the war in Gaza. You've called for a ceasefire hostage deal and a two-state solution as an end to the war for many months now. And while you've expressed support for Israel to defend itself, a two-state solution and a ceasefire are at odds with what Benjamin Netanyahu has said is their right to defense. If it matters, as you say, how Israel defends itself, where do you see the line between aggression and defense and our power as Israel's ally to do something? Okay, a lot to unpack in what you just said. So let's start with this. I absolutely believe that this war has to end and it has to end as soon as possible. And the way that will be achieved is by getting a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. And we are working around the clock to achieve that end. Stepping back October 7th, 1200 Israelis were slaughtered, actually, and some Americans, by the way, in that number, slaughtered. Young people who were attending a concert, women were horribly raped. And yes, so I have said Israel has a right to defend itself. We would, and... But Madam Vice President, I think my ask is the difference between aggression and defense. But it's important to put it in context, which is what I'm doing and I'll get to that. And so how it does so matters. And far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Women and children. We have seen with horror the images coming out of Gaza. And we have to take that seriously. And we have to agree that not only must we end this war, but we have to have a goal of a two-state solution because there must be stability and peace in that reason. In as much as what we do in our goal is to ensure that Israelis have security and Palestinians in equal measure, have security, have self-determination and dignity. A question for you on that, though. What levers does the US have to support Palestinians in their right to self-determination? And is it even possible as Israel's ally? Well, absolutely. I will tell you, I have been actively involved in, for example, meeting not only with Israeli officials but with Arab officials to talk about how we can construct a day after scenario where we participate in ensuring those exact goals that I outlined, including as part of the principles that should be applied to those goals, that there be no reoccupation of Gaza, that there be no changing of the territorial lines in Gaza, that there be an ability to have security in the region for all concerned in a way that we create stability and let us also recognize in a way that ensures that Iran is not empowered in this whole scenario in terms of the peace and stability of the region. But absolutely, the United States of America absolutely has a role, which is why we have been active in particular with the Qataris and the Egyptians around attempting to get a deal done and get it done as quickly as possible. But as a matter of fact, just to follow up really quickly, is there a specific policy change that you as President of the United States would say you would do that would help this along? Because you've gotten a lot of credit for emphasizing the humanity of Palestinians. But what I often hear from folks is that there's no policy change that either you or the President Biden have gone and said they would do. Is there a specific policy change as President that you would do in our helping of Israel? We need to get this deal done. And we need to get it done immediately. And that is my position and that is my policy. We need to get this deal done. But in the way that we send weapons, in the way that we interact as their ally, are there specific policy changes? Well, Eugene, for example, one of the things that we have done that I am entirely supportive of is the pause that we've put on the 2000 pound bombs. And so there is some leverage that we have had and used. But ultimately, the thing that is gonna unlock everything else in that region is getting this deal done. And I'm not gonna disclose private conversations, but I will tell you, I've had direct conversations with the Prime Minister, with the President of Israel, with Egyptian leaders, and with our allies. And I think we've made ourselves very clear that this deal needs to get done in the best interest of everyone in the region, including getting those hostages out who, I mean, we saw the latest example of what happened with the six most recently, one of whom was an American citizen. But what do you say to those that say that's not enough, that stopping the 2000 pound bombs the one time wasn't enough, that this administration, and your possible administration, have to do more? Well, we are doing the work of putting the pressure on all parties involved to get the deal done. But let me be very clear also, I support Israel's ability to defend itself. And I support the need for Palestinians to have dignity, self-determination, and security as we move forward and get a two state deal done. But right now, the thing we need to get done is this hostage deal and the ceasefire deal. We need a ceasefire, we need the hostage deal. I wanna switch gears to racial justice, Madam Vice President. Last month, you eulogized Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Jackson Lee's signature bill, one of a few, was HR 40, which would create a commission to study the history of US slavery and study the issue of reparations. She introduced HR 40 every session of Congress, taking up the mantle from Congressman John Conyers. This is a bill that you have cosponsored as a US Senator. Yet, despite the fact that this has been, similar commissions have been created on the state level and on the local level, it's yet to pass in Congress, let alone come out of committee. Congresswoman Jackson Lee, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, and other advocates have called for President Biden to take executive action to create this commission. Would you as president take executive action to create this commission, or do you believe that it should happen in Congress? Well, first of all, I just, as you mentioned, Sheila Jackson Lee, she was an extraordinary leader, who we just recently lost, and she was a friend and a real champion for so many issues. So, they'll compel to say that about her. On the issue of what we need to do going forward, look, first of all, we just need to speak truth about history in spite of the fact that some people would try and erase history and try and teach our children otherwise. We need to speak truth about the generational impact of our history in terms of the generational impact of slavery, the generational impact of redlining, of Jim Crow law. I could go on and on and on. These are facts that have had impact. And we need to speak truth about it, and we need to speak truth about it in a way that is about deriving solutions. And frankly, I think that we, and part of that is studying it to figure out exactly what we need to do. But part of what we can do right now is, for example, what I'm talking about in terms of building an opportunity economy, which is addressing explicitly the obstacles that historically and currently exist. And dealing with them, student loan debt, medical debt, bias in home appraisals. What we need to do in terms of dealing with an issue that I have championed for years, black maternal mortality, which is the fact that black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women. And we know that the reasons for that include disparities that pre-exist her pregnancy, including disparities that exist in the system during her pregnancy. So all of those things must be addressed. Do you have a position on whether that should happen, this commission should happen through executive order or via Congress? I think Congress ultimately will have the ability to do this work. I'm not discounting the importance of any executive action, but ultimately Congress. Because if you're gonna talk about it in any substantial way, there will be hearings, there will be a level of public education and dialogue that, and I think that was part of the spirit behind the congressional action thus far, to ensure that everyone can participate in this conversation in a way that elevates knowledge about history and the reference points that have, that are the impetus of this conversation. Especially again, when people are trying to deny history, when people are, you know, so-called leaders are saying that enslaved people benefited from slavery. I mean, let's talk about the delta here in terms of the work that needs to be done. It's profound. Madam Vice President, I wanna move to Springfield, Ohio, and what's happening there. We've seen school closures, parents worried about their kids leaving the home because of racist conspiracy theories that I won't repeat here, but they have been repeated by leaders on the Republican side, President Trump, Vice President, excuse me, former President Trump, and Vice Presidential nominee, J.D. Vance. From your perspective, is this just a case of irredeemable racism that can't be mitigated by any rational action, or is this a situation in which a federal response could help this community heal? There's a question of resources and- Well, I'll let you finish from then I'll speak. No, go ahead, Ms. B. It's a crying shame. I mean, my heart breaks for this community. You know, there were children, elementary school children, who it was school photo day. You remember what that's like? Going to school on picture day. Who were dressed up in their vest, got all ready, knew what they were gonna wear the night before, and had to be evacuated. Children, children. A whole community, put in fear. And I'll say a couple things about it. One, you know, I learned a long time ago in my career, having a background as a prosecutor. When you have these positions, when you have that kind of microphone in front of you, you really ought to understand at a very deep level, how much your words have meaning. I learned at a very young stage of my career, that the meaning of my words could impact whether somebody was free or in prison. As attorney general, I was of California, fifth largest economy in the world. I was acutely aware that my words could move markets. When you are bestowed with a microphone that is that big, there is a profound responsibility that comes with that, that is an extension of what should not be lost in this moment, this concept of the public trust. To then understand what the public trust means. It means that you have been invested with trust to be responsible in the way you use your words much less how you conduct yourself. And especially when you have been and then seek to be again president of the United States of America. And so I go back to, it's a crying shame, literally. What's happening to those families, those children in that community, not to mention what is happening in terms of, look, you say you care about law enforcement, law enforcement resources being put into this because of these serious threats that are being issued against a community that is living a productive good life before this happened. And spewing lies that are grounded in tropes, that are age old. And look, I said it not very far from here the other day at the debate. This is not new. This is not new in terms of these tropes. This is not new in terms of where it's coming from. And whether it is refusing to rent to people, rent to black families, whether it is taking out a full page ad in the New York Times against five innocent black and Latino teenagers, Central Park Five, calling for their execution. Whether it is referring to the first black president of the United States with a lie, birth or lies. And look, the American people deserve, and I do believe more better than this. I do believe that. I know, I know the vast majority of us as Americans know we have so much more in common than what separates us. I know that. I know that regardless of someone's background, their race, their gender, their geographic location, I know that people are deeply troubled by what is happening to that community in Springfield, Ohio. And it's gotta stop. And we've gotta say that you cannot be entrusted with standing behind the seal of the president of the United States of America, engaging in that hateful rhetoric that as usual is designed to divide us as a country, is designed to have people point and fingers at each other. It's designed to do that. And I think most people in our country, regardless of their race, are starting to see through this nonsense. And to say, you know what, let's turn the page on this. This is exhausting and it's harmful. And it's hateful. And grounded in some age old stuff that we should not have the tolerance for. So let's turn the page and chart a new way forward and say you can't have that microphone again. Madam Vice President, I'm switching gears again. Quick question, I want to talk to you about gun control. So you've said you support an assault weapons ban and universal background checks. And we actually learned during the debate that you are a gun owner. But in cities like Philadelphia, handguns are responsible for most homicides and violent crime. The most recent FBI data shows handguns were involved in 59% of murders in our country. How will you address the issue of the use of handguns? Because a push for an assault weapons ban only addresses a significant but small part of the problem. So first of all, yes, I am a gun owner and Tim Walz is a gun owner and we're not trying to take anybody's guns away from them. But we do need an assault weapons ban. Assault weapons are designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly. And have no place, I'm gonna get to it. And have no place on the streets of a civil society. We need universal background checks. Which to your point about handguns is about saying that it is just reasonable to want reasonable gun safety laws that say we should do background checks that we ought to know. It's just reasonable, you might wanna know before someone can buy a lethal weapon if they've been found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others. You might just wanna know. And respectfully, we do understand that. But you're asking about, I'm asking specifically about handguns because many of those handguns are purchased in places. Yes. Universal background checks apply to handguns. They do. But in many instances, those handguns aren't even bought lawfully. Yes. Which is why I also have been very adamant for years. In fact, I myself protested at a gun show probably 10, 15 years ago about the gun show loophole and why we need to close that. Because what ends up happening is that gun shows at flea markets, gun dealers are not under existing law in the past required to register their sales. And so you are exactly right. That a lot of homicides, for example, a good number of them, I have the statistic in front of my mind, are committed with illegally purchased guns. And that's why we need to address each entry point in the issue, including universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole, and what we need to do as a general matter to focus not only on reaction to crime, but prevention of crime. So you're raising a very important issue that has many facets, including what we need to do in terms of reasonable gun safety laws, and what we need to do around crime prevention, what we need to do around crime deterrence. But listen, I have personally prosecuted homicide cases. I have held the hands of mothers who have come to me crying, who said I only wanna talk to Kamala, because they knew when they sat down, I would treat them with the dignity and respect that they were entitled and do, about the loss of their child, often their son, took on violence and the need to take it seriously. And we must take it seriously. In every way, understanding, it's not just about a sound bite. It's about a comprehensive approach that deals with the tragedy of, to your point, every day gun violence in America. It's real. It has had a profound impact in terms of trauma that for the most part has gone undiagnosed and untreated, the trauma that exists in communities around the violence of losing their children, losing a brother, losing a father and uncle. All of that must be addressed. And we have to have a holistic response to it. Are there things we haven't thought about yet, because every time we bring up this issue of gun violence, universal background checks comes up and a ban on assault weapons. Are there other solutions that you're also thinking about that will get at this issue? Absolutely. For example, part of what we did with, so we, as vice president with the president, we were able to pass the first meaningful gun safety legislation in 30 years. And part of what that involved was millions and millions of dollars to put more mental health counselors in public schools. Right? Because we know that there is an aspect of this that is about treating the trauma and dealing with it at its source before it ends up manifesting itself in a problem. There is the work that we need to do that is about putting resources into communities around violence prevention. I've been a big advocate of that for years, which includes what we need to do around putting resources into community-based intervention that is not just requiring on the good people in the community to volunteer to do the intervention, but actually paying people to do it, because it's a full-time job. It's about understanding what we need to do to, again, understand that to your point, we have to have a holistic response to this issue. And prioritize it instead of reacting to the tragedy that, sadly, they are too predictable. Let's all agree, enough of that. There are very few solutions that we haven't thought of. We need to put the resources into them. Madam Vice President, we want to move to the topic of reproductive access, something that you have worked in leading on, both for the administration, Democrats, and now the top of the ticket. You've said that as president, you would want to codify a role if it came to your desk. You would sign a bill that did that. Role protected access until fetal viability, which it also says is, quote, at about seven months, but may occur earlier even at 24 weeks. So do you similarly support also codifying roles restrictions which allowed states to ban abortion in the third trimester of pregnancy unless necessary to save the mother's life? We need to put the protections of Roe v. Wade back into law. And when that bill gets passed by Congress, I will proudly sign it into law. Understand what is happening in our country. Over 20 states have passed what I call Trump abortion bans because understand how we got here. The former president handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended, and in state after state, laws have been passed criminalizing healthcare providers. I don't know if anyone here has heard most recently the stories out of Georgia. Tragic story. About a young woman who died because it appears the people who should have given her healthcare were afraid they'd be criminalized after the Dobbs decision came down. Laws that make no exception even for rape or incest, which means that you're telling a survivor of a crime of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, which is immoral. An approach that doesn't take into account that most people, I think, agree, you don't have to abandon your faith or deeply held beliefs to agree. The government should not be telling her what to do with her body. If she chooses, she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her imam, but it should not be the government or Donald Trump telling her what to do about her own body and her life. So that's where I stand. We need to put back in place the protection of Roe v. Wade. And put that into law. And those restrictions that are also in place. We need to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade and let an individual in consultation with her doctor make the decision based on what she can determine because she's smart enough to know what's in her best interest instead of having her government tell her what to do, especially a bunch of people in these state capitals who think they're in a better position to tell her what to do than she is to know what's in her best interest. Before we conclude, Madam Vice President, the joyful warrior has been used to describe her campaign. You didn't see that just a minute ago, though. Yeah. Okay, back to my joyful priorities. And your opponent and Republicans have, at times, weaponized you laughing in campaign ads, for example. Why is joy important to you to insert into this election? And what do you make of Republicans using that as a way to suggest that you're not a serious candidate? Well, sometimes, I think, and I'll say to whoever the young people are who are watching this, there are sometimes when your adversaries will try and turn your strength into a weakness, don't you let them. Don't you let them. I find joy in the American people. I find joy in optimism in what I see to be our future and our ability to invest in it. I find joy in the ambition of the people. I find joy in the dreams of the people. I find joy in building community. I find joy in building coalitions. I find joy in believing that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, but who you lift up. And I think we should all find joy. And have a sense of optimism about who we are as Americans and what we mean to each other and what we can do to lift each other up. Madam Vice President, did you, President Biden spoke to former President Trump after the attempt on his life this weekend? Did you have you spoken to him and earlier today, I assume? Yes. How'd that go? You want to give us some intel? Sure. I checked on to see if he was okay. And I told him what I have said publicly. There is no place for political violence in our country. I am in this election and in this race for many reasons, including to fight for our democracy. And in a democracy, there is no place for political violence. We can and should have healthy debates and discussion and disagreements, but not resort to violence to resolve those issues. On January 6th, your vehicle was allowed to kind of pass the viable pipe bomb. We've seen this. No, I was in the building. You were in the building. And we've seen what's happening with former President Trump. Do you have full confidence in the Secret Service to protect all of you? I do. You feel safe for you and your family? I do. But I mean, you can go back to Ohio. Not everybody has Secret Service. And there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe. I mean, I look at Project 2025 and I look at, you know, like the don't say gay laws coming out of Florida, members of the LGBTQ community, don't feel safe right now. Immigrants or people with an immigrant background don't feel safe right now. Women don't feel safe right now. And so, yes, I feel safe. I have Secret Service protection. But that doesn't change my perspective on the importance of fighting for the safety of everybody in our country. And doing everything we can to, again, lift people up and not beat people down so they feel alone and are made to feel small and made to feel like there's somehow not a part of it or us. Madam Vice President, thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Thank you. I've appreciated it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",full,6688
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"whether or not voters are better off now than they were four years ago. Are they better off now than they were four years ago? So when we came into, well first of all, let me just say it is good to be with the National Association of Black Journalists and I thank you for the work you do and that your members do every day. It is very important that we ensure that this organization and your members always have the resources and the platforms to deliver the voices that must be heard. So I thank you for hosting me today. Four years ago when we came in, we came in during the worst unemployment since the Great Depression. We came in during the worst public health epidemic in centuries. We came in after the worst attack on our democracies since the Civil War. And a lot of it do in large part to the mismanagement by the former president as it relates to COVID and obviously January 6th. And we had then a lot of work to do to clean up a mess. As of today, we have created over 16 million new jobs, over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. We have the lowest black unemployment rate in generations. We have invested in small businesses and they're to the benefit of many people, but including black small businesses, some of the highest rate of creation of new black small businesses in years. We have done the work of capping the cost of prescription medication for our seniors for issues like insulin. And again, I'm speaking to the black journalists who care about all people, but in particular, I'll talk about the impact on black people where we know black folks are 60 times more likely, 60%, excuse me, more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. And we have now finally capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month, capped the cost of prescription medication for our seniors at $2,000 a year because we, unlike the former president who promised to do it, we finally have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices against the big pharmaceutical companies. And these are just some of the accomplishments.",chunk_1,369
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"Is the price of grocery still too high? Yes. Do we have more work to do? Yes. And I will tell you, I do believe that I offer a new generation of leadership for our country that is about, in particular, turning the page on an era that sadly has shown us attempts by some to incite fear to create division in our country and to do the work that is about bringing some level of optimism and, dare I say, ambition about what I know is possible in our country. And so my plan for the economy includes what I imagine and believe and call an opportunity economy, what we can do to grow an opportunity economy where all people have access to the resources to compete to apply their incredible work ethic, their ambition, their aspirations and their dreams and actually not just get by but get ahead. And I can talk in more detail about it, but specifically I'll mention a few things. Yeah. One of the big issues that affects people right now in terms of the economy and their economic wellbeing is we have a shortage of housing supply. It's too expensive, people can't afford to buy a home. You know, we grew up, our parents, where they had the ability to somehow believe the American dream was attainable. Not so much for younger working people. And I recognize that. So my approach is a new approach which is to say, let's just take this and deal with it head on. And part of my approach is to say, I'm gonna employ and engage the private sector, in particular home builders with tax credits to give them the incentive to create new housing, three million by the end of my first term and understanding that not everybody is handed a silver spoon but works hard and is trying to save up for a down payment. Part of my plan under my opportunity economy is to give first time home buyers a $25,000 down payment assistance so they can just get their foot in the door to be able to then engage in what will prove to be their opportunity to build intergenerational wealth. And here's my personal experience coming at that. I grew up a middle class kid.",chunk_2,383
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"My mother was hard working, she raised me and my sister, Maya. She saved up and it was only by the time I was a teenager that she could afford to actually buy her first home. And I know, and I identify with, I know where I come from. Madam Vice President. And I know, but I'm just gonna finish. I know that so many people work so hard and should have the opportunity to just get their foot in the door. Again, so it's not just about getting by but getting ahead, please. I'd like to ask you more about the opportunity economy. Housing is a part of it, as well as expanding the earned income tax credit, financial support, as you mentioned, for first time buyers and a $50,000 tax deduction for startups and small businesses. But I wanna talk to you about the squeeze that millions of Americans are also dealing with that impacts their ability to work and make money. And that is childcare and elder care. And it's a squeeze for millions of people. In some parts of the country, it costs more for childcare than for rents. I think Rumberg recently reported an average of $33,000 a year. So I'm just wondering, you mentioned that in your opportunity economy, a child tax credit, but that's just one part of an ecosystem. Please tell us what plans will you propose to guarantee that families can actually afford childcare and elder care? So to your point, it is sadly the state of affairs in our country that working people often have to decide to either be able to work or be able to afford childcare. Like they can't afford childcare and actually do the work that they want to do because it's too expensive and it doesn't actually level out in terms of the expense versus the income. My plan is that no family, no working family should pay more than 7% of their income in childcare. Because I know that when you talk about the return on that investment, allowing people to work, allowing people to pursue their dreams in terms of how they want to work, where they want to work, benefits us all. It's strengthened the entire economy.",chunk_3,375
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"We saw, for example, during the pandemic, what happened? And it sadly has dissipated as a conversation that we need to resuscitate, which is the number of women that had to leave the workforce because of the lack of childcare and home healthcare and so many of our families, and particularly women end up carrying the responsibility, men do too, of course, what we call people who are in the sandwich generation. Exactly. Who have young children and are also taking care of their parents. And it is just absolutely too expensive for them to be able to work and do that. So my plan is not only about 7% of income for working people for childcare, but also we need to do better for our childcare providers and our home healthcare providers in terms of ensuring that they receive the wages that they deserve based on the dignity of their work. I have spent time with home healthcare providers. And their work is some of the most taxing work you can imagine. And I actually, when my mother was sick with cancer, did a lot in terms of taking care of her. And the work that is about taking care of a loved one in particular, an elder, is extraordinarily heavy in terms of the emotional toll, the time it takes, and we do it, because that is what we do, but not everyone has the ability to take time from work to do it, and they need help. And we need to make sure we have home healthcare workers that can help them. But I want to also get back to the earlier point that you made about extending the child tax credit. So part of my new approach is we need to expand the child tax credit. And so part of my plan that is under an opportunity economy is to extend and expand the child tax credit to $6,000. So that young families in particular, for the first year of their child's life, which is an extraordinarily important time in their development, have the resources to be able to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy children's clothing, and not have to worry about whether they're gonna be able to meet their other needs. And I don't need to remind anybody here, especially these esteemed journalists, but when we expanded the child tax credit a couple years ago, we reduced black child poverty by half.",chunk_4,410
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"And so again, if you talk about the benefit, and if you think about the benefit, to the economy overall, it strengthens our economy to do things like pay attention to affordable childcare, affordable home health care, and extending the child tax credit. Madam Vice President, black men, as you know, are a closely watch voting bloc. You've hosted black men at your residence. You have engaged black men and centered them in your economic opportunity tour. But polling shows that some black men, particularly young black men, are considering voting for Donald Trump, and they see him as better for the economy. What is your message to young black male voters who feel left out of this economy, and how can your economic policies materially change their lives? So I appreciate the spirit of the question, but I'll tell you, I've often been asked this question in a way that I've had to respond by first saying, that I think it's very important to not operate from the assumption that black men are in anybody's pocket. Black men are like any other voting group. You gotta earn their vote. So I'm working to earn the vote, not assuming I'm going to have it because I am black, but because the policies and the perspectives I have understands what we must do to recognize the needs of all communities. And I intend to be a president for all people, specifically as it relates to what we need to do, to your point, around economic opportunity. Yes, I started way before I was at the top of the ticket, at what I called an economic opportunity tour, focused on black men. Understanding that, for example, we have so many entrepreneurs in the community who do not have access to capital, but they've got great ideas, an incredible work ethic, the ambition, the aspiration, the dream, but don't have the relationships necessarily. So my work has included, as vice president, getting billions more dollars into community banks, including working with the big banks to do that, so that we can increase access to capital for our small businesses, for our startups.",chunk_5,359
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"Part of my plan under my economic opportunity plan going forward is that right now, startup entrepreneurs, small businesses, only get a tax deduction of $5,000. Nobody can start a small business with $5,000. So I'm expanding that to $50,000. Understanding, again, that when people have the opportunity to have the resources to get started, they're gonna put the good ideas, they're gonna put the hard work into it. And part of what I also know is that our young black men, our black men, just like any group of people, anybody, our small businesses are really the backbone of our economy overall, and when they do better economically, we all do better. Part of my work is about understanding what we need to do in dealing with, for example, the historic inequities that have faced the black community around home ownership. I don't have to go through the history with anybody here about what that has meant in terms of redlining, what that has meant in terms of biases in home appraisals, and what the impact it has had on stemming the opportunity to build intergenerational wealth because of those obstacles. So part of the work that I have done and will continue to do is identify, speak truth about those obstacles and address them. Another example is medical debt. One in four black families or individuals is more likely to carry medical debt than others. So part of my perspective and as vice president, part of the work that we have done is to say that we're gonna eliminate medical debt from being on your credit score because until now, medical debt worked against your credit score and people know their credit score, like you wait, you know that number. And the difference between what that number is and what it needs to be is the difference between you being able to get a car loan, a small business loan, or even a lease on an apartment. And so part of my approach is understanding the obstacles that traditionally and currently exist to allow anyone, including black men, be able to achieve economic wealth.",chunk_6,356
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"And I'm gonna tell you, I don't think it is sufficient to just only talk about economic policy around reducing unemployment. It is an important marker. And I'm proud of the work that we've done thus far, but it should be a baseline there, everybody's working. The point is, do people have an opportunity to build wealth? If that's what they choose to do, if that's what they want to do. And a lot of my perspective as we go forward is just that. I believe that there are a lot of opportunities that are available to the American people if we just see people and understand what they want for themselves and their families and then meet them where they are. Madam Vice President, I wanna switch gears a little bit and talk about the war in Gaza. You've called for a ceasefire hostage deal and a two-state solution as an end to the war for many months now. And while you've expressed support for Israel to defend itself, a two-state solution and a ceasefire are at odds with what Benjamin Netanyahu has said is their right to defense. If it matters, as you say, how Israel defends itself, where do you see the line between aggression and defense and our power as Israel's ally to do something? Okay, a lot to unpack in what you just said. So let's start with this. I absolutely believe that this war has to end and it has to end as soon as possible. And the way that will be achieved is by getting a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. And we are working around the clock to achieve that end. Stepping back October 7th, 1200 Israelis were slaughtered, actually, and some Americans, by the way, in that number, slaughtered. Young people who were attending a concert, women were horribly raped. And yes, so I have said Israel has a right to defend itself. We would, and.. But Madam Vice President, I think my ask is the difference between aggression and defense. But it's important to put it in context, which is what I'm doing and I'll get to that. And so how it does so matters. And far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.",chunk_7,376
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"Women and children. We have seen with horror the images coming out of Gaza. And we have to take that seriously. And we have to agree that not only must we end this war, but we have to have a goal of a two-state solution because there must be stability and peace in that reason. In as much as what we do in our goal is to ensure that Israelis have security and Palestinians in equal measure, have security, have self-determination and dignity. A question for you on that, though. What levers does the US have to support Palestinians in their right to self-determination? And is it even possible as Israel's ally? Well, absolutely. I will tell you, I have been actively involved in, for example, meeting not only with Israeli officials but with Arab officials to talk about how we can construct a day after scenario where we participate in ensuring those exact goals that I outlined, including as part of the principles that should be applied to those goals, that there be no reoccupation of Gaza, that there be no changing of the territorial lines in Gaza, that there be an ability to have security in the region for all concerned in a way that we create stability and let us also recognize in a way that ensures that Iran is not empowered in this whole scenario in terms of the peace and stability of the region. But absolutely, the United States of America absolutely has a role, which is why we have been active in particular with the Qataris and the Egyptians around attempting to get a deal done and get it done as quickly as possible. But as a matter of fact, just to follow up really quickly, is there a specific policy change that you as President of the United States would say you would do that would help this along? Because you've gotten a lot of credit for emphasizing the humanity of Palestinians. But what I often hear from folks is that there's no policy change that either you or the President Biden have gone and said they would do. Is there a specific policy change as President that you would do in our helping of Israel? We need to get this deal done.",chunk_8,380
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"And we need to get it done immediately. And that is my position and that is my policy. We need to get this deal done. But in the way that we send weapons, in the way that we interact as their ally, are there specific policy changes? Well, Eugene, for example, one of the things that we have done that I am entirely supportive of is the pause that we've put on the 2000 pound bombs. And so there is some leverage that we have had and used. But ultimately, the thing that is gonna unlock everything else in that region is getting this deal done. And I'm not gonna disclose private conversations, but I will tell you, I've had direct conversations with the Prime Minister, with the President of Israel, with Egyptian leaders, and with our allies. And I think we've made ourselves very clear that this deal needs to get done in the best interest of everyone in the region, including getting those hostages out who, I mean, we saw the latest example of what happened with the six most recently, one of whom was an American citizen. But what do you say to those that say that's not enough, that stopping the 2000 pound bombs the one time wasn't enough, that this administration, and your possible administration, have to do more? Well, we are doing the work of putting the pressure on all parties involved to get the deal done. But let me be very clear also, I support Israel's ability to defend itself. And I support the need for Palestinians to have dignity, self-determination, and security as we move forward and get a two state deal done. But right now, the thing we need to get done is this hostage deal and the ceasefire deal. We need a ceasefire, we need the hostage deal. I wanna switch gears to racial justice, Madam Vice President. Last month, you eulogized Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Jackson Lee's signature bill, one of a few, was HR 40, which would create a commission to study the history of US slavery and study the issue of reparations. She introduced HR 40 every session of Congress, taking up the mantle from Congressman John Conyers.",chunk_9,371
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"This is a bill that you have cosponsored as a US Senator. Yet, despite the fact that this has been, similar commissions have been created on the state level and on the local level, it's yet to pass in Congress, let alone come out of committee. Congresswoman Jackson Lee, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, and other advocates have called for President Biden to take executive action to create this commission. Would you as president take executive action to create this commission, or do you believe that it should happen in Congress? Well, first of all, I just, as you mentioned, Sheila Jackson Lee, she was an extraordinary leader, who we just recently lost, and she was a friend and a real champion for so many issues. So, they'll compel to say that about her. On the issue of what we need to do going forward, look, first of all, we just need to speak truth about history in spite of the fact that some people would try and erase history and try and teach our children otherwise. We need to speak truth about the generational impact of our history in terms of the generational impact of slavery, the generational impact of redlining, of Jim Crow law. I could go on and on and on. These are facts that have had impact. And we need to speak truth about it, and we need to speak truth about it in a way that is about deriving solutions. And frankly, I think that we, and part of that is studying it to figure out exactly what we need to do. But part of what we can do right now is, for example, what I'm talking about in terms of building an opportunity economy, which is addressing explicitly the obstacles that historically and currently exist. And dealing with them, student loan debt, medical debt, bias in home appraisals. What we need to do in terms of dealing with an issue that I have championed for years, black maternal mortality, which is the fact that black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women. And we know that the reasons for that include disparities that pre-exist her pregnancy, including disparities that exist in the system during her pregnancy.",chunk_10,380
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"So all of those things must be addressed. Do you have a position on whether that should happen, this commission should happen through executive order or via Congress? I think Congress ultimately will have the ability to do this work. I'm not discounting the importance of any executive action, but ultimately Congress. Because if you're gonna talk about it in any substantial way, there will be hearings, there will be a level of public education and dialogue that, and I think that was part of the spirit behind the congressional action thus far, to ensure that everyone can participate in this conversation in a way that elevates knowledge about history and the reference points that have, that are the impetus of this conversation. Especially again, when people are trying to deny history, when people are, you know, so-called leaders are saying that enslaved people benefited from slavery. I mean, let's talk about the delta here in terms of the work that needs to be done. It's profound. Madam Vice President, I wanna move to Springfield, Ohio, and what's happening there. We've seen school closures, parents worried about their kids leaving the home because of racist conspiracy theories that I won't repeat here, but they have been repeated by leaders on the Republican side, President Trump, Vice President, excuse me, former President Trump, and Vice Presidential nominee, J.D. Vance. From your perspective, is this just a case of irredeemable racism that can't be mitigated by any rational action, or is this a situation in which a federal response could help this community heal? There's a question of resources and- Well, I'll let you finish from then I'll speak. No, go ahead, Ms. B. It's a crying shame. I mean, my heart breaks for this community. You know, there were children, elementary school children, who it was school photo day. You remember what that's like? Going to school on picture day. Who were dressed up in their vest, got all ready, knew what they were gonna wear the night before, and had to be evacuated.",chunk_11,343
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"Children, children. A whole community, put in fear. And I'll say a couple things about it. One, you know, I learned a long time ago in my career, having a background as a prosecutor. When you have these positions, when you have that kind of microphone in front of you, you really ought to understand at a very deep level, how much your words have meaning. I learned at a very young stage of my career, that the meaning of my words could impact whether somebody was free or in prison. As attorney general, I was of California, fifth largest economy in the world. I was acutely aware that my words could move markets. When you are bestowed with a microphone that is that big, there is a profound responsibility that comes with that, that is an extension of what should not be lost in this moment, this concept of the public trust. To then understand what the public trust means. It means that you have been invested with trust to be responsible in the way you use your words much less how you conduct yourself. And especially when you have been and then seek to be again president of the United States of America. And so I go back to, it's a crying shame, literally. What's happening to those families, those children in that community, not to mention what is happening in terms of, look, you say you care about law enforcement, law enforcement resources being put into this because of these serious threats that are being issued against a community that is living a productive good life before this happened. And spewing lies that are grounded in tropes, that are age old. And look, I said it not very far from here the other day at the debate. This is not new. This is not new in terms of these tropes. This is not new in terms of where it's coming from. And whether it is refusing to rent to people, rent to black families, whether it is taking out a full page ad in the New York Times against five innocent black and Latino teenagers, Central Park Five, calling for their execution. Whether it is referring to the first black president of the United States with a lie, birth or lies.",chunk_12,384
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"And look, the American people deserve, and I do believe more better than this. I do believe that. I know, I know the vast majority of us as Americans know we have so much more in common than what separates us. I know that. I know that regardless of someone's background, their race, their gender, their geographic location, I know that people are deeply troubled by what is happening to that community in Springfield, Ohio. And it's gotta stop. And we've gotta say that you cannot be entrusted with standing behind the seal of the president of the United States of America, engaging in that hateful rhetoric that as usual is designed to divide us as a country, is designed to have people point and fingers at each other. It's designed to do that. And I think most people in our country, regardless of their race, are starting to see through this nonsense. And to say, you know what, let's turn the page on this. This is exhausting and it's harmful. And it's hateful. And grounded in some age old stuff that we should not have the tolerance for. So let's turn the page and chart a new way forward and say you can't have that microphone again. Madam Vice President, I'm switching gears again. Quick question, I want to talk to you about gun control. So you've said you support an assault weapons ban and universal background checks. And we actually learned during the debate that you are a gun owner. But in cities like Philadelphia, handguns are responsible for most homicides and violent crime. The most recent FBI data shows handguns were involved in 59% of murders in our country. How will you address the issue of the use of handguns? Because a push for an assault weapons ban only addresses a significant but small part of the problem. So first of all, yes, I am a gun owner and Tim Walz is a gun owner and we're not trying to take anybody's guns away from them. But we do need an assault weapons ban. Assault weapons are designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly. And have no place, I'm gonna get to it. And have no place on the streets of a civil society.",chunk_13,379
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"We need universal background checks. Which to your point about handguns is about saying that it is just reasonable to want reasonable gun safety laws that say we should do background checks that we ought to know. It's just reasonable, you might wanna know before someone can buy a lethal weapon if they've been found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others. You might just wanna know. And respectfully, we do understand that. But you're asking about, I'm asking specifically about handguns because many of those handguns are purchased in places. Yes. Universal background checks apply to handguns. They do. But in many instances, those handguns aren't even bought lawfully. Yes. Which is why I also have been very adamant for years. In fact, I myself protested at a gun show probably 10, 15 years ago about the gun show loophole and why we need to close that. Because what ends up happening is that gun shows at flea markets, gun dealers are not under existing law in the past required to register their sales. And so you are exactly right. That a lot of homicides, for example, a good number of them, I have the statistic in front of my mind, are committed with illegally purchased guns. And that's why we need to address each entry point in the issue, including universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole, and what we need to do as a general matter to focus not only on reaction to crime, but prevention of crime. So you're raising a very important issue that has many facets, including what we need to do in terms of reasonable gun safety laws, and what we need to do around crime prevention, what we need to do around crime deterrence. But listen, I have personally prosecuted homicide cases. I have held the hands of mothers who have come to me crying, who said I only wanna talk to Kamala, because they knew when they sat down, I would treat them with the dignity and respect that they were entitled and do, about the loss of their child, often their son, took on violence and the need to take it seriously.",chunk_14,367
2024-09-17,Interview,"Harris participated in a televised interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",chunk,"And we must take it seriously. In every way, understanding, it's not just about a sound bite. It's about a comprehensive approach that deals with the tragedy of, to your point, every day gun violence in America. It's real. It has had a profound impact in terms of trauma that for the most part has gone undiagnosed and untreated, the trauma that exists in communities around the violence of losing their children, losing a brother, losing a father and uncle. All of that must be addressed. And we have to have a holistic response to it. Are there things we haven't thought about yet, because every time we bring up this issue of gun violence, universal background checks comes up and a ban on assault weapons. Are there other solutions that you're also thinking about that will get at this issue? Absolutely. For example, part of what we did with, so we, as vice president with the president, we were able to pass the first meaningful gun safety legislation in 30 years. And part of what that involved was millions and millions of dollars to put more mental health counselors in public schools. Right? Because we know that there is an aspect of this that is about treating the trauma and dealing with it at its source before it ends up manifesting itself in a problem. There is the work that we need to do that is about putting resources into communities around violence prevention. I've been a big advocate of that for years, which includes what we need to do around putting resources into community-based intervention that is not just requiring on the good people in the community to volunteer to do the intervention, but actually paying people to do it, because it's a full-time job. It's about understanding what we need to do to, again, understand that to your point, we have to have a holistic response to this issue. And prioritize it instead of reacting to the tragedy that, sadly, they are too predictable. Let's all agree, enough of that. There are very few solutions that we haven't thought of. We need to put the resources into them.",chunk_15,361

You've said that as president, you would want to codify a role if it came to your desk. You would sign a bill that did that. Role protected access until fetal viability, which it also says is, quote, at about seven months, but may occur earlier even at 24 weeks. So do you similarly support also codifying roles restrictions which allowed states to ban abortion in the third trimester of pregnancy unless necessary to save the mother's life? We need to put the protections of Roe v. Wade back into law. And when that bill gets passed by Congress, I will proudly sign it into law. Understand what is happening in our country. Over 20 states have passed what I call Trump abortion bans because understand how we got here. The former president handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended, and in state after state, laws have been passed criminalizing healthcare providers. I don't know if anyone here has heard most recently the stories out of Georgia. Tragic story. About a young woman who died because it appears the people who should have given her healthcare were afraid they'd be criminalized after the Dobbs decision came down. Laws that make no exception even for rape or incest, which means that you're telling a survivor of a crime of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, which is immoral. An approach that doesn't take into account that most people, I think, agree, you don't have to abandon your faith or deeply held beliefs to agree. The government should not be telling her what to do with her body. If she chooses, she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her imam, but it should not be the government or Donald Trump telling her what to do about her own body and her life.",chunk_16,370

Wade and let an individual in consultation with her doctor make the decision based on what she can determine because she's smart enough to know what's in her best interest instead of having her government tell her what to do, especially a bunch of people in these state capitals who think they're in a better position to tell her what to do than she is to know what's in her best interest. Before we conclude, Madam Vice President, the joyful warrior has been used to describe her campaign. You didn't see that just a minute ago, though. Yeah. Okay, back to my joyful priorities.

But I mean, you can go back to Ohio. Not everybody has Secret Service. And there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe. I mean, I look at Project 2025 and I look at, you know, like the don't say gay laws coming out of Florida, members of the LGBTQ community, don't feel safe right now. Immigrants or people with an immigrant background don't feel safe right now. Women don't feel safe right now. And so, yes, I feel safe. I have Secret Service protection. But that doesn't change my perspective on the importance of fighting for the safety of everybody in our country. And doing everything we can to, again, lift people up and not beat people down so they feel alone and are made to feel small and made to feel like there's somehow not a part of it or us. Madam Vice President, thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Thank you. I've appreciated it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",chunk_18,336
2024-09-18,Event, Harris spoke at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 2024 Leadership Conference,full,"Good afternoon everyone and I am so very excited to welcome you all to this very exciting special session at the 2024 Leadership Conference of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. Nobody's here to listen to me so it is my pleasure to introduce the representative from the 13th Congressional District of the great state of New York and the chairman of the board of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, the Honorable Adriano Espallat. Thank you Marco. Buenas tardes. Buenas tardes. Okay, I see that got to you, that lunch got to you. No? Uh oh, I'm in trouble. This week is a momentum week for CHCI. As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, welcoming over 2,000 of you Latinos from across the country and recognizing our legacy and the impact and our growing influence across the nation. As we face crossroads in America, the Latino community plays a pivotal role in making sure that our nation moves forward. And at this crossroad, it is crucial that our young people, yes you, our young people, register to vote and make their voices heard at the polls every time. And continually on the front lines, this is how we ensure that our seniors are protected. This is how we ensure that we have high quality healthcare. Our families have access to economic opportunity and our freedoms are protected and safeguarded. We all know that our families deserve affordable healthcare, quality education for our children and more good paying jobs for our community. The person I'm about to introduce will be the leader who is focused on our future, a leader who delivers for us a champion who ensures that every person, each and every one of you is able to thrive. Together with President Biden, this person helped create 16 million jobs, including five million jobs for Latinos across the country. Get this, she delivered, that's right, she delivered the lowest national unemployment rate in more than 50 years and the lowest Latino unemployment rate in record. This person has remained a relentless advocate for Latino community and has consistently, yes consistently, worked to amplify our voices and build a more inclusive and prosperous future for Latinos and all Americans. This person is a daughter of immigrants. Yes, this person is a former San Francisco district attorney. This person is the former attorney general of the state of California and the United States senator. This person is the first woman to serve as vice president of these United States. Please get up and help me welcome the vice president of these United States, Kamala Harris. Please have a seat, please have a seat, please have a seat. Oh, it's good to see so many friends. I love you back. I want to recognize Chair Barragan, where are you? My dear friend, fellow Californian, I want to thank you for all that you do and all that you have done. CHCI Chair, Espalat, thank you for all that you are. You know, he spent, both of them have spent time with me at my house and we've shared a lot of good stories together and many meals together and I just want to personally thank them both because they really, as you know, are extraordinary people and extraordinary leaders and they do so much on behalf of so many. So thank you both for your leadership and for hosting me this afternoon. And to all the incredible leaders here, it is an honor to be with you again and to everyone happy Hispanic Heritage Month, which in my book is every month of the year. So this is a room of longstanding friends and many of you know my background. My mother arrived in the United States when she was 19 years old by herself and I spoke about it recently, actually. You know, my mother, I was the eldest child and as the eldest child, those of us who are, you know, you see a lot of things in terms of what your parents go through. And I would often see how my mother was treated. She was a five foot tall, brown woman with an accent. And I would see how the world would sometimes treat her. When I'm going to tell you something and this is where I come from, my mother never lost her cool. She never defined her sense of dignity based on how others treated her. She was a proud woman, she was a hard working woman. She had two goals in her life. To raise her two daughters, my sister Maya and me, and to end breast cancer. She was a breast cancer researcher. And growing up, our mother taught us certain fundamental values. The importance of hard work. The power of community. And the responsibility that we have to not complain about anything. Much less injustice, right? Because why are you complaining about it, she would say? Do something about it. And that's how I was raised. Do something about it. And those values have guided me my entire career. From, as you heard, being a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California. We're Bay Area. 106.1 KVL. That was our local radio station for hip hop. But doing that work, part of the background on why I became a prosecutor was actually when I was in high school, I learned that my best friend was being, abused, being molested by her stepfather. And when I learned about it, I told her she had to come live with us. And I called my mother and my mother said, of course she does, and she did. And so I decided I wanted to start a career and do the work of, in part, just doing the work of making sure that we protect the most vulnerable. And so I started my career as a courtroom prosecutor. And took on those who would be predators against the most vulnerable. As Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for homeowners who were middle class families who faced foreclosure because of predatory lending practices. I stood up for veterans and students who were being scammed by the big for profit colleges, knowing the, in many of whom had an immigrant background, and were just simply trying to do the best they could to invest in themselves and their family for their future. And the subject of awful scams. I have stood up in my career for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due. And for seniors who have faced elder abuse. And I say all that to say, when I stand here before you today, this is not just something that I decided to do, but really is about a lifelong career that has been about fighting for the people. For the people. And for years, I have been proud to fight alongside the members and the leaders of this incredible caucus. And almost all of that work. And the work we have done together has been about so much I just talked about. It has been about defending workers' rights. It has been about expanding healthcare for more Americans, including dreamers. It has been about forgiving billions of dollars in student loan debt, including for many of the folks that we know, friends, relatives, who again have been burdened by that heavy debt and just needed to be seen. Teachers, firefighters, nurses. The work we have done together has been to create the National Museum of the American Latino. And of course, last year I was proud to be with a lot of the leaders here in Houston for the CHC on the road tour. So I say that to say that CHC, our work together, has always been guided by shared values and by a shared vision. However, at this moment, we are confronting two different, very different visions for our nation. One focused on the past. The other, ours focused on the future. We fight for a future, for affordable healthcare, affordable childcare and paid leave. We fight for a future where we can build what I call an opportunity economy, understanding that the people of our country, the people we know have extraordinary ambition and aspirations and dreams of what they can be, what they can do, are prepared to do the hard work and put that hard work in, but don't necessarily always have access to the opportunities to achieve and realize those goals. So I see in America where everyone has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business. I believe in a future. We together believe in a future where we can lower the cost of living for America's families so that people have an opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. And so with the work we have done together and going forward, we will continue to lower the cost of groceries, for example, by taking on something that I think is very important to deal with, which is price gouging on behalf of big corporations. You know, I've seen that happen before. Many of you who have come from states where we've seen extreme weather conditions in California wildfires in other parts of the country or even in the pandemic where people are desperate because of these kinds of emergencies, desperate for support and then some, you know, corporation, and it's very few of them that do this, but then jack up prices to make it more difficult for desperate people to just get by. We need to take that on. We need to lower the cost of housing. We don't have enough housing in our country. The supply is too low and it's too expensive, both for renters and for folks who want to buy a home. So we will build together millions of new homes and give first-time home buyers $25,000 in down payment assistance. Because look, people just want to get their foot in the door. My mother worked hard. She saved up. It wasn't until I was a teenager that she was able to buy our first home. And the American dream is elusive for far too many people increasingly. And that's why it is part of my perspective that let's just do the work of giving first-time home buyers a $25,000 down payment assistance. Let them get their foot in the door. We need to lower the cost of health care and continue to take on big pharma and cap the cost of prescription medications. Yes, for our seniors, which we have done together, but for all Americans. Because when we look at drugs like insulin, everyone here knows. First of all, Latinos are 70% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. And with the support of CHC, we were able to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for our seniors. In fact, recently I was in Nevada. I'm in these streets. I'm everywhere. But I was recently in Nevada and a woman came up to me with tears in her eyes. She showed me the receipts for her mother's insulin. And she showed me many papers and I said, tell me what these are. And she said, well, these are the receipts. And I want you to see where it used to cost us hundreds, if not $1,000 a month, but no more. The work we are doing together, the very purpose of CHC and all of the leaders here includes having a real impact on real people. And I have the blessing of being able to travel our country and see it every day. It's extraordinary work that is happening because of the leaders here. We, because of our work together, have finally given Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices with big pharma. And understand, if my opponent Donald Trump wins, his allies in Congress intend to end Medicare and end Medicare's negotiating power as they remind us again this week. They are essentially saying, check this out, because you know, you have to ask why, right? So why would you want to end Medicare's negotiating power against big pharma? And essentially they're saying that it's not fair to big pharma. That's essentially what they're saying. But I'll tell you what's not fair. What's not fair is that our seniors for too long have had to cut pills in half because they cannot afford their full medication. That's not fair. It's not fair that our seniors have had to choose between filling their prescriptions and putting food in their refrigerator or paying their rent. That's not fair. And that's why we will continue to do our work together, including Fight Project 2025, an agenda that would cut Medicare and increase the cost of healthcare in our country. Because we stand with the people and on the side of the people. We will also cut taxes for working families, including restoring and expanding the child tax credit. Because we know this is the kind of work that must happen if we are to be true to our values and be true to understanding that parents, in particular young parents, need that support. When we extend the child tax credit, cut child poverty by 50% by half. Think about what that meant for so many families. The vast majority of parents have a desire to raise their children well. They love their children. But don't necessarily have the resources to do everything their child needs. I grew up understanding the children of the community are the children of the community. And we should all have a vested interest in ensuring that children can go grow up with the resources that they need to achieve their God-given potential. So I know where I come from. And we have to always put, and I know CHC agrees with this, and this is part of our collective life's work. We have to put the middle class first, we have to put working families first, understanding their dreams and their desires and their ambitions deserve to be invested in, and it will benefit everyone. And together, CHC, we must also reform our broken immigration system and protect our dreamers and understand we can do both, create an earned pathway to citizenship and ensure our border is secure. We can do both, and we must do both. And while we fight to move our nation forward to a brighter future, Donald Trump and his extremist allies will keep trying to pull us backward. We all remember what they did to tear families apart. And now they have pledged to carry out the largest deportation, a mass deportation in American history. Imagine what that would look like and what that would be. How's that going to happen? Massive raids? Massive detention camps? What are they talking about? They will also give billions of dollars of tax cuts to billionaires and corporations, massive tax cuts, pardon January 6 perpetrators, who attacked our capital not far from here. They will cut Social Security and Medicare. They intend to end the Affordable Care Act and threaten the healthcare of more than 5 million Latinos in our country, all based on, I'm sure many of you saw the debate. So on that point about the Affordable Care Act, all based on concepts, let me plan. Concepts. Concepts. Their project 2025 agenda would pull our nation backward. But we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. Instead, together, we will chart a new way forward because ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. The freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body. And not have her government telling her what to do. And understand on that last point how we got here. Everyone here knows Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would do just what they did, which is to overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. And now in more than 20 states we have a Trump abortion ban, which criminalized healthcare providers in one state providing prison for life. You guys may have heard the story, many hear about the stories about the horrendous, most recent stories about what happened in Georgia. Many of these Trump abortion bans that make no exception for rape or incest, it's immoral. It's immoral. And today 40% of Latinas in America live in a state with a Trump abortion ban. So imagine if she is a working woman, understand that the majority of women who seek abortion care are mothers. Understand what that means for her. So she's got to now travel to another state, God help her that she has some extra money to pay for that plane ticket. She's got to figure out what to do with her kids. God help her if she has affordable childcare. Imagine what that means. She has to leave her home to go to an airport, stand in a TSA line. Like think about this, you know, everybody here is your policy leaders. I always say to my team, especially the young people I mentor, on any public policy you have to ask how is this going to affect a real person. Ask how it would affect a real person. Go through the details. So she's got to stand in a TSA line to get on a plane sitting next to a perfect stranger, going to a city where she's never been, to go and receive a medical procedure. She's going to have to get right back to the airport because she got to get back to those kids and it's not like her best friend can go with her because the best friend is probably taking care of the kids. All because these people have decided they're in a better position to tell her what's in her best interest than she is to know. It's just simply wrong. And I think we all know one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. If she chooses, if she chooses she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her emomb, but not the government telling her what to do. And I pledge to you when CHC helps pass a law to restore reproductive freedoms as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. Proudly. So friends, we have some work to do. In fact, a lot of hard work ahead of us. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work, I say. And I truly believe that America is ready to turn the page on the politics of division and hate. And to do it, our nation is counting on the leaders here. Your power, your activism. And so I thank you in advance for your work to register people to vote and get people to the polls. Each of us has a job to do. As we celebrate this month, we know we stand on broad shoulders of people before us who have passed us now the baton. Those heroes who fought for freedom, who have now passed the baton onto us. And the bottom line is we know what we stand for. So we know what to fight for. And when we fight, we win. God bless you. And God bless you and have a safe trip. Thank you.",full,3315

2024-09-18,Event, Harris spoke at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 2024 Leadership Conference,chunk,"And not have her government telling her what to do. And understand on that last point how we got here. Everyone here knows Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would do just what they did, which is to overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. And now in more than 20 states we have a Trump abortion ban, which criminalized healthcare providers in one state providing prison for life. You guys may have heard the story, many hear about the stories about the horrendous, most recent stories about what happened in Georgia. Many of these Trump abortion bans that make no exception for rape or incest, it's immoral. It's immoral. And today 40% of Latinas in America live in a state with a Trump abortion ban. So imagine if she is a working woman, understand that the majority of women who seek abortion care are mothers. Understand what that means for her. So she's got to now travel to another state, God help her that she has some extra money to pay for that plane ticket. She's got to figure out what to do with her kids. God help her if she has affordable childcare. Imagine what that means. She has to leave her home to go to an airport, stand in a TSA line. Like think about this, you know, everybody here is your policy leaders. I always say to my team, especially the young people I mentor, on any public policy you have to ask how is this going to affect a real person. Ask how it would affect a real person. Go through the details. So she's got to stand in a TSA line to get on a plane sitting next to a perfect stranger, going to a city where she's never been, to go and receive a medical procedure. She's going to have to get right back to the airport because she got to get back to those kids and it's not like her best friend can go with her because the best friend is probably taking care of the kids. All because these people have decided they're in a better position to tell her what's in her best interest than she is to know. It's just simply wrong.",chunk_8,384
2024-09-18,Event, Harris spoke at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 2024 Leadership Conference,chunk,"And I think we all know one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. If she chooses, if she chooses she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her emomb, but not the government telling her what to do. And I pledge to you when CHC helps pass a law to restore reproductive freedoms as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. Proudly. So friends, we have some work to do. In fact, a lot of hard work ahead of us. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work, I say. And I truly believe that America is ready to turn the page on the politics of division and hate. And to do it, our nation is counting on the leaders here. Your power, your activism. And so I thank you in advance for your work to register people to vote and get people to the polls. Each of us has a job to do. As we celebrate this month, we know we stand on broad shoulders of people before us who have passed us now the baton. Those heroes who fought for freedom, who have now passed the baton onto us. And the bottom line is we know what we stand for. So we know what to fight for. And when we fight, we win. God bless you. And God bless you and have a safe trip. Thank you.",chunk_9,261
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",full,"Hi! So welcome to my... Oprah! Hello! Madam Vice President. Hello. Welcome to Michigan. It's so good to be back in Governor. Thank you for everything you are and everything you do for the state. Thank you. Well, thank you. Can you see this? We have a thousand screens here. Oh my goodness. Representing people from all over the country. Hi everyone. Can you feel? Can you feel? Can you feel it? Can you feel? The joy rising in here? I can and I have to tell you there's so much that I love about our campaign because it really is about the people. And I look around at these screens, Oprah. I look at who's in the room and this is America. This is. This is America. You know, I was saying with a group of friends earlier, I think in this moment where we've dealt with so much that I think is quite exhausting around powerful forces that would try and divide us and try us to have us as Americans pointing fingers at each other. Yes. That this movement that is about reminding each other that we have so much more in common than what separates us is so critically important. And this is about the strength of who we are as Americans. And this movement that we're in about, as I like to say, seeing in the face of a stranger, a neighbor. Yes, yes, yes, yes. An extension of love thy neighbor that you literally in the face of a stranger see a neighbor. Yes. And approach each other with that level of dignity and grace and kindness. Well, that's exactly what happened with the win with black women. I know you've known Jo Tate for many years. Thank you, my dear. That's exactly what happened. She started it. Is that the fact? They just started it. So it had to be careful. It had to be called. And then it said, let's open the door. Let's open the door and invite everybody else in. And everybody actually came. Organically. Yes. Organically. Like, this is the beauty of our country. There's so much at stake in this election. And ultimately, the question before us is what kind of country do we want to live in? And the beauty of the democracy, as long as we can hold on to it. The beauty of a democracy is each of us has the power. Each of us has the power to answer that question. That's right. Everybody on this call and beyond has the power. But can I just start with this? Yes, please. I have to say this, because in all of my private conversations, Gail, and I've said this 100 times, and everybody is saying it, you all have said it. I know you have. It seems to us that something happened to you. The moment Joe Biden, President Biden, stepped aside and withdrew his candidacy, that a veil or something dropped, and you just stepped into your power. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then the next week, I saw you walking in the thing. And I said, what happened to you? You know, we each have those moments in our lives where it's time to step up. Time to step up. Time to step up. You know? Well, the moment you heard, I mean, I really have been saying to people it felt like a veil dropped, and you sort of stepped through that veil. Did that actually? Did you feel like that? I felt a sense of responsibility, to be honest with you. And with that comes a sense of purpose. But I mean, we're all here, and you all are taking time out of your busy lives. Everyone here. Everyone on the screen. Because there really is so much at stake. You know, I have spent the majority of my career being concerned about the well-being of other people. Yeah. As I've said, my career is a prosecutor. I never looked at a victim or a witness and asked them, are you a Republican or a Democrat? The only thing I've asked them is, are you OK? Are you OK? I know when I heard that. You know? Touch me. And traveling this country and knowing what is at stake in terms of fundamental freedoms, what's at stake in terms of fighting against hate and those efforts to divide us. And I do know that I'm in a position to do something about it. So I felt a great responsibility. And the incredible power of the people, right, who, I'm not the only leader in this. We're all leaders in this. This is so much bigger than me. It's about who we are as Americans. And it's about making clear what we stand for. And what we stand for is it is about the ideals upon which we were founded, including the importance of freedom and the importance of independence and the importance of dignity and purpose. But it is also about what we stand for in terms of our values. I think of it this way. I think a lot boils down to values. I just said values are on the line here. It does. I mean, think about it, Oprah. The idea that some would suggest, and that my opponent suggests, which is that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. Come on. The real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. And it's important for us to articulate that. You know, ever since the debate, we feel for our fellow citizens in Springfield. Do you not think about the fellow citizens in Springfield, Ohio, the Haitian families, the non-Haitian families, everybody having to deal with this lie that has endangered the lives of Haitian people and anybody who looks Haitian. Everybody in America feels for that. And also, everybody in America, left, right, middle, has concerns about immigration. And I'm told that Justin, Justin, where are you in the audience? Justin? Hello. In the audience. Hello, Madam Vice President. You live in Michigan? Yes, ma'am. Don't you love saying hello, Madam Vice President? I do. What's your question? It's an immigration question. So you, when you become president, what would be your specific steps? Yeah, of course. What would be your specific steps to strengthening the border? So it's a wonderful and important question. I, you know, my background was as a prosecutor. And I was also the elected attorney general for two terms of a border state. So this is not a theoretical issue for me. This is something I've actually worked on. I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. I take very seriously the importance of having a secure border and ensuring the safety of the American people. Sadly, where we are now can be traced most recently back to the fact that when the United States Congress, members of the Congress, including some of the most conservative Republicans, came up with a border security bill. And here's what that border security bill would have done. It would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border. And let me tell you, those border agents are working around the clock. It would have just been about giving them some support and relief, which is probably why the border agents actually endorsed the bill. It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl. And I'm looking at people from all over the country here. So I don't need to tell the folks who are watching this what fentanyl has done to families, to kids in our country, and the need to take seriously stemming the flow coming into our country and addressing that extraordinary and tragic issue in terms of its effect. The bill would have allowed us to have more resources to prosecute transnational criminal organizations. And it would have been part of the solution. And Donald Trump called up those folks and said, don't put that bill on the floor for a vote. He blocked the bill. And you know why? Because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he has put his personal political security before border security. Because understand, even in the intervening months, what that bill would have done to give support to folks who care about this issue. And this, again, gets to the point about what does leadership really look like? And is it about you or is it about the people? Is it about running on problems or fixing problems? My work and my career has always been about saying, let's fix problems. Let's address the needs. Because we know it's within our capacity to do that. So to answer Justin's question, now that that bill has gone and hasn't passed, will you reintroduce that? Absolutely. And when I am elected president of the United States, I will make sure that bill gets to my desk. And I will sign it into law. Thank you, Justin. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Listen to this. A majority of young Americans, 18 to 34, say that the cost of living is their top issue ahead of the election. Let's take a look. Groceries are extremely expensive right now. I don't understand how people are affording life right now. For so many Americans, the high cost of living is their top concern this election. Rachel, we have $435 to last us to the end of the month. OK? What? In Philadelphia, Rachel and Garrett say they have to watch every penny. When I think of middle class, I think about people who are able to just get up and go and do things within their means and not extravagant things, but be able to get up and go to dinner whenever they want, or maybe take that trip, that long weekend trip. We don't have that luxury. By a long shot, her tax plan is phenomenal, no glaze. Kamala Harris just delivered her new economic plan. And boy, oh boy, is it good for small business owners. Holy shit, you guys. Kamala Harris is going to announce tomorrow a $25,000 tax credit for first time home buyers. When I am elected president, I will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans. Well, Rachel and Garrett are joining us on Zoom from Pennsylvania. And I understand your sister and brother-in-law moved in, and you're hoping to save money to have a second child. That's right. Hi, Oprah. Hi, Madam Vice President. It's nice to be with you all. Yes. And so what did you want to say to the vice president? So Madam Vice President, we are like many, many young Americans just experiencing a very high cost of living. We ended up giving up our apartment, moving in with our parents, who were so gracious to take us in for over a year so that we could save money and ultimately buy a home, because that's what we thought the American dream was, to get married and buy a home and have a baby. And now here we are and our mortgage is incredibly higher than what we thought it would be. And my sister and our brother-in-law are living with us right now so that they can hopefully one day do the same. And while it's beneficial for us because they help us pay off some of our mortgage, it's also beneficial for them because they can save on cheaper rent. But we really would love to know what your plan is to help lower the cost of living. Yeah. First of all, thank you both for being here. And yours is a story I hear around the country as I travel. And in terms of both rightly having the right to have aspirations and dreams and ambitions for your family and working hard and finding that the American dream is for this generation and so many recently far more elusive than it's been. And we need to deal with that. And there are a number of ways. One is bringing down the cost of everyday necessities, including groceries. So that's why I'm taking on, for example, price gouging, which is when most companies and corporations are good. But for those bad ones, they take advantage of people, especially during a pandemic or extreme weather. And they end up jacking up prices. And there needs to be accountability and consequence for that. So I'm going to be taking on price gouging. But it's also about dealing with what we need to do around home ownership. So as someone mentioned during this film, look, I grew up a child of a mother who worked very hard. She raised me and my sister. And she saved up. And by the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy a home. And we grew up actually for a long time in an apartment on top of a child care center that was owned by the woman we called our second mother because she helped my mother raise us. And she was a small business owner, Michelle Tyn. So I'll bring all of this together to tell you the way I think about it is one, when people work hard and have a dream of buying a home, we should give you the opportunity to be able to do that, which is why part of my plan is for first-time homeowners, buyers, to have a $25,000 down payment assistance to buy your first home. Because people just need to be able to get their foot in the door and then you'll do the hard work. Part of my plan is what we need to do to support small businesses because my second mother was a small business owner and I love our small businesses and our small business owners. They are not only business leaders, they are community leaders. They mentor, they hire locally. And we have so many entrepreneurs in our country who have great ideas, incredible work ethic, but not necessarily access to capital because not everybody like my opponent was handed $400 million on a silver plate that he filed bankruptcy six times on. And so part of my plan is to give startup small businesses a $50,000 tax deduction to start up their small business. Right now it's $5,000. Nobody can start a small business with $5,000. So that's part of my plan. That's a teeny-tiny business. That's a business in a tiny business. It's a concept of a business. Right? Yes. You know where I go. That's right. It's still on paper with the $5,000. It just hasn't happened. Part of the, to speak to you guys and your family and your dreams is what we need to do around giving middle class families tax breaks. And so part of my plan is also to extend and expand the child tax credit to $6,000 so that you can, in the first year of your child's life, have the resources to be able to buy a crib and a car seat and clothes for your baby knowing that's such an extraordinarily important time in their development. And you shouldn't have to worry about how you're going to take care of their basic needs. All of this and more is part of what I plan to build and I call it an opportunity economy. And it's basically about creating opportunities, knowing so many people have the ambition, have the aspirations, are working hard, but just need opportunity to reach their goals and their dreams. I saw you smiling with that $25,000 credit for the home. I saw that smile on your face and the $6,000. Thank you all so much. I want to just introduce Jude to Shelby, who's also in our virtual audience. Thank you guys. Shelby from Virginia, who's also struggling with the cost of living. Tell us your story, Shelby. Why? Hi. Hi, Madam Vice President. Hi, I'm Brad. I'm 24 years old. I'm a graduate student living with my parents and I want to move out next year and potentially buy a home. And I'm concerned about the affordability of one with the extra cost and bills I'm paying now along with the bills and costs I will pay in the future too. And so everything just has a cost and everything is so expensive. And so I'm worried about my capacity and how I'm able to fully support myself once I do live independently. You sound like one of my daughter girls from South Africa graduated. She was like, I hate adulting. I hate adulting. This adulting isn't going so well. Yes. Well, so first of all, congratulations on all the success you've already achieved. And it is your story and the story of our friends before you is really, that's the American story, right? You are working hard. You have goals. You have ambitions. And so part of it is again, the $25,000 down payment assistance. Part of it is what we need to do to also push back against a very different vision for our country because look in this election, there are two very different visions for our country. One for me that is focused on the future, including you and another that is focused on the past. What Donald Trump, what my opponent plans on doing for the economy is doing what he did the last time he was president and giving another tax break for billionaires and the biggest corporations that would add $5 trillion to our deficit and get this. He plans on doing what I call a Trump sales tax, which is basically he's going to put a 20% tax on everyday necessities. That economists have estimated will cost the average American $4,000 more a year, which is why Goldman Sachs, which is why Moody's, which is why Wharton School of Business, which is why 16 Nobel laureates have collectively determined after analyzing our plans one mind would strengthen the economy, his would weaken it. Two, that on his plan he would actually blow up inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So when you think about the cost of living, my approach is about lifting you up. His would be about actually weakening our economy. And I feel very strongly when an individual, when a small business, when a family, when the middle class is strong, America is strong. Amen to that. Amen to that. Thank you, Shelby. Thank you, Rachel and Garrett. So the Harris campaign kicked off the Fighting for Reproductive Freedom Bus Tour to support the fundamental right for women to make decisions about our own bodies. And here is a short tape on that. I did something that nobody thought was possible. I got rid of Roe v. Wade. After Roe v. Wade was overturned, Tennessee put forth a ban immediately. That banned all abortion with no exceptions. Abortion bans are not for life. They are pro-poverty and pro-invulability. It's been over two years since a five to four ruling by the Supreme Court ended Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that provided nearly 50 years of abortion rights across the United States. Our body! Since then, abortions have been banned in over a dozen states. Many women and doctors say the limits on reproductive rights have forced them into unimaginable situations. These policies do not reflect evidence-based medical practice. They do not keep my patient safe. According to the gender equity policy, women who live in states where abortion is banned are up to three times more likely to die during pregnancy, during childbirth, or soon after giving birth. I nearly died all because of Donald Trump's Supreme Court justices overturning Roe v. Wade. So for the millions of you who watched the Democratic National Convention, you will remember Hadley DeVall telling her incredibly powerful story. In case you didn't see it, here's just a brief look. Growing up, I was an all-American girl. Varsity soccer captain, cheerleading captain, homecoming queen, and survivor. I was raped by my stepfather after years of sexual abuse. At age 12, I took my first pregnancy test, and it was positive. Hadley is here. Stand up, Hadley. Thank you. I can tell you, we are all standing up because we are so impressed by your courage to stand up and share your story. Where did that come from, the strength to do this? Because I'm sure you thought long and hard before deciding to go public with your story. When Roe v. Wade was overturned, I woke up with a harsh reality of my abuse was over but my story is not. And I just could not fathom thinking about the other Hadleys out there that don't have that choice, that don't have somebody to go to. So being able to find courage and be the light for them, that's really what I do it for. And so what do you want to say to other people who are voting in this election regarding what happened to you and what that means? You can't wait until it's too late to care about reproductive health care, because then it's too late. And when it affects you, it hits and you can't deny it. You can't look at someone with a story like mine and say it didn't happen. And there are more people like me out there and there are going to be so many more who deserve their options. They deserve their choices. Let's get involved. We have someone who's willing to hear us at a level like never before. We have someone who wants to know what we want in this country. We have someone who wants to lift up our voice. And we need to show out and show up for her just like she's showing out and showing up for us. Alright. Is there something you want to say to Madam Vice President? Madam Vice President, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for seeing us, for hearing us when the Supreme Court won't. Thank you for fighting and really showing us that life is not about the hard things that you go through. It's not about down. Even when you're the underdog, especially when you're the underdog. You stand up and you stand tall and you give me so much hope and so much strength. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Madam Vice President, for coming all this way. I hope you continue to use your voice. I hope you continue that. This week, the case of a young woman who lost her life after the abortion ban took place in Georgia made national headlines. Amber's case came to light through the reporting of journalist Kavita Serana with ProPublica. And so listen to her story. Two years ago, 28-year-old Amber Nicole Thurman, a medical assistant and a single mother to a six-year-old boy, found out she was pregnant. Amber had just secured her own apartment and was thinking about going to nursing school. She made the decision to terminate her pregnancy. A strict abortion ban had recently taken place in her home state of Georgia, which caused Amber to travel to North Carolina for the procedure. Traffic made her miss the appointment, so the clinic gave her medication, what are known as abortion pills. Once back home, Amber experienced profuse bleeding, vomiting, severe pain. She eventually passed out. Her boyfriend called for an ambulance. At the Georgia hospital, Amber's condition deteriorated quickly. In a rare occurrence, it was discovered her body had not expelled all the fetal tissue and an infection was spreading. Official Georgia State Medical Expert analysis of her case says Amber should have received a life-saving D&C, but doctors waited 20 hours before deciding to take her to surgery. Amber's blood pressure had taken a dive, or organs had started failing. In the operating room, her heart stopped. On the way to surgery, Amber's last words to her mother were, Promise me you'll take care of my son. Amber's mother, Shannette and older sisters CJ and Andrika are here, and they wanted to be here tonight to speak out for the first time. Ms. Shannette, what do you want us to know about Amber's story? Initially, I did not want the public to know my pain. I wanted to go through in silence, but I realized that it was selfish. I want y'all to know Amber was not a statistic. She was loved by a family, a strong family, and we would have done whatever to get my baby, our baby, the help that she needed. When ProPublica came to my home, I pushed them away. No, no, no, but Cavitea, she kept, she was persistent. She said, it was something that you needed to know. You have to hear me. Women around the world, people around the world need to know that this was preventable. Two years later, after speaking with my daughters, because I lost strength, I lost hope, you're looking at a mother that is broken. The worst pain ever that a mother, that a parent could ever feel, her father and myself and the family, you're looking at it. Well, we appreciate so deeply you being here. We're all watching you hear that tape in those words. We know how re-traumatizing that is and the strength it takes for you to be here to tell your story. And we deeply appreciate it. And I have to ask you, as her sisters, how are you coping? And what does knowing that this could have been prevented, how does that sit with you? How do you cope with that on a daily basis? I mean, it's heartbreaking. That was my baby sister. I love my baby sister. I'm beyond hurt, disappointed. I feel guilty. I wish I could have helped her because she was suffering. And we had no idea we trusted them to take care of her. And they just let her die because of some stupid abortion ban. They treated her like she was just another member. They didn't care for her as if she was their daughter or their granddaughter. And she's not here. She'll never come back. Yeah. Andrika, what do you want to say? I want to say that it is very disheartening that my sister was allowed to suffer for 20 hours. She suffered. It was nothing that we could do to help her. We trusted the healthcare professionals to do their job and save her, but they failed her. Well, I think the most powerful thing that you've said here, Ms. Jeanette, is that your daughter is not a statistic. She had a life. She was loved by her sisters, loved by her family, loved by those who knew her, and she's not just a statistic. And we are happy to speak her name tonight in this room talking about what this country needs in terms of reproductive rights and freedom. What do you want to say, Madam Vice President? I'm just so sorry. And the courage that you all have shown is extraordinary because also you just learned about how it is that she died. And... They just recently learned. How? Yeah. And Amber's mom shared with me that the word over and over again in her mind is preventable. Yeah. Preventable. That word keeps coming to her. And this story is a story that is sadly not the only story of what has been happening since these bands have taken place. And, you know, so just to step back in terms of how we got here, the former president chose three members of the United States Supreme Court. With the intention that they would overdo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did as he intended, and in state after state, including yours, these abortion bands have been passed that criminalize healthcare providers in a couple of states prison for life opera. Prison for life in a couple of states for a doctor or a nurse who provides healthcare. And so it seems very apparent that... Even when the mother's life is in danger. See, here's the problem with that. Here's the problem with that. So is she on death's door before you actually decide to give her help? Mm-hmm. That's the problem. Is that what we're saying? Yeah. That you've got to prove you're on death's door. Like, literally a doctor or a nurse has to say, she might die any minute. Better give her now care. Because otherwise I might go to prison for life in some cases. Think about what we're doing in terms of saying that certain people who are in these state houses and then starting with the former president of the United States think they're in a better position than a doctor or a nurse to determine when their patient needs medical care. This literally in an amber story highlights the fact that among everything that is wrong with these bans and what has happened in terms of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, it's a healthcare crisis. It's a healthcare crisis that affects the patient and the profession. And going back to Hadley's story, and Hadley, you've been so remarkable in telling your story and being so strong in the way you do it. And both of these stories really, I mean the courage... Y'all, I love that. That's a big takeaway because we're all feeling really good right now. But what really matters is what are we going to do? What are we going to do? Thank you so much, Star. I see somebody else on the screen. Julia Roberts. Hi, Julia. Hi, Julia. I heard you were so excited you wanted to be here tonight. Why? Well, first of all, Oprah, thank you for hosting this because I guess if I started a voting club, it would be conversationalists for Kamala. Because to talk, to listen, to be heard, to have this back and forth is so unique in this campaign to beautiful, wonderful Kamala Harris, who I've had the good fortune of knowing. And I am a mother of two kids. This is their first chance to vote in an election. And I couldn't be more excited for them to have the legacy to say that their first vote they ever cast for president was for you. I have just chills saying that out loud. Are you all going to the polls together? Are you organizing a party? Are the motors having a poll party? What's happening? I wish we were all going together. In fact, you know, they are in college, so we will be separated on the great day. But in spirit, united always for what we believe in and what we, you know, I feel like it's interesting. We talk so much about being Americans united for something, but this has become such a global representation of our country and what we stand for. And I get to travel internationally a lot. And I want people to say, oh, you're American and not, oh, how's it going over there? You know, yes. So I want to get back to that space. Exactly. Thank you, Julia. Exactly. Thank you. And hey, there's Tracy Ellis Ross coming up there. Tracy, we should not listen. If anybody should have a voting party, I think it should be at your house because you have great parties, girl. I just want to say hi. Hello, Madam Vice President. It's just an honor. I actually have never met you, which is crazy. And hi, Oprah. What did I miss? We just saw each other the other day. Oh, hi, Tracy. Hi. Hi, Oprah. How are you doing? Yeah. This is exciting, though, isn't it? Isn't it exciting? It's exciting. It's exciting because I believe in democracy. I believe in the future of our country in reproductive freedom, bodily autonomy, women leading. I believe in decency. The idea of leading with joy and kindness has always been in my DNA. And I'm here both for the seriousness of this election, but the joy with which it is being handled. It is stunning. And then I also really want to remind everybody it hasn't been mentioned, but voting up and down the ballot is exciting. Your freedom and your daily life are all the way up and down that ballot. People are policies and we need the right people in all areas, all positions. And then I would like to say to you two women, thank you for what you represent, because as a 52-year-old childless woman, I want to say to the people who think that a woman's worth is measured in her baby count. I mean, shout out to all the amazing mothers, but the childless women have been mothering the world in elevating culture as Godmothers, teachers, mentors, sisters and friends, and lists goes on. And you do not need to push out a baby to help push humanity forward. Amen to that. Thank you so much. Tracy Ellis Ross. Thank you so much. So another important issue of this election is, of course, our safety. And just two weeks ago, our country experienced yet another horrific school shooting. Watch this. It's 10.30 a.m. at Rob Elementary in Uvalde. The school is recognizing my 10-year-old daughter Lexi for receiving all A's. 30 minutes later, a gunman murders her, 18 classmates and two teachers. In the last 25 years, there have been 417 school shootings in the United States, and more than 383,000 students have experienced gun violence while at school. More children and adolescents are killed by guns each year than anything else nationwide. Just two weeks ago, Appalachee High School in Winder, Georgia became the latest area to face every parent's worst nightmare. Tonight breaking news as we come on the air, the deadly high school shooting. Two students and two teachers killed. Police and parents racing to the scene outside Atlanta. Oh my goodness. There is a shooting at my granddaughter's school. We had to drag our teacher's body into the classroom. We heard him take his last breath. We live in a country where 383,000 children have been exposed to gun violence. Now just sit with that number for a second. It's a number until it's your child. This is not normal, y'all. This is not normal. And this is not right. Other people in other countries do not have this issue. We Americans, we have to do better. We have to do better. We cannot continue to just settle for our thoughts and prayers. Lives are being destroyed. 15 year old Natalie Griffith and her parents, Doug and Marilda are here. And Natalie, we are so sorry to know that you two have been added to that number. Because you were in algebra class when you were shot twice by a 14 year old fellow student. We're so glad that you lived to tell your story. And so how are you tonight? Well before that thing, the video, I was very happy. I still am very happy to be here and to tell my story and what happened. Because it was a terrible thing. And it should not have... Where were you shot? I was shot right here on my shoulder and then around here. I was saying that 383,000 students in our country, the United States of America, have been exposed to violence. That same scene that you experienced in your school. Had you all been having drills or preparation for what should happen? Should there be a shooting? I've had intruder drills and fire drills and stuff. In my old schools we had a fire drill at Apalachee. But it was the first two months of the school year we hadn't had an intruder drill yet. So we weren't even completely sure where to go in the classroom. We all just... I remember being like huddled. So I was watching your mother even just when that tape was coming on. It's still very much PTSD, very much traumatic. You're still reliving it and how has it been for you? How were you notified that there was a shooting at the school? I was notified by a friend. She called me, I was at work. And she called me and she said, do you know about the shooting? Which school does she go to? Apalachee said no, I don't. And then she said there was a shooting at Apalachee High School. My heart just dropped and my heart just got so heavy and I could not stop. I had to leave. I told my coworkers I had to go, I had to leave. And my first thing I did was drop my knee on the floor and just I prayed. I prayed for about 30 minutes for my work on the way to the school. I didn't get to get to the school on my car. I had to leave my car at a gas station about two, maybe two and a half, three miles. And I walked on foot and I ran because my heart was so heavy I could not get... I couldn't get a good touch on my daughter. And I hear you have a message for people in power regarding guns now? I do. I want to finish that story because no parent should go through this. I want to just finish what the experience, you do not know what feels until it's you. All those numbers that you show on the TV, a lot of people are here are mothers. What are we doing about this? What are we doing? Let's make sure that everybody listens and makes sure that everybody hears. The whole world needs to hear that we women have our children, we have a job. That job is to protect our children. That job is to protect our nation. That job is to protect our country. We cannot let that. We cannot leave. We cannot let that go home. We have to stop it. You know, I was asking earlier where are those people? All the other shooting, where are they? They needed to make a noise. I'm ready to make a noise about this and I'm ready to stop it because no one, no one knows what feels when you keep finding a child. When you call her, you call her, just not answering. When I went through it, you know, it's just me that knows it. And I'm so sorry for those that lost, that the children actually died. I can actually hug my child. My child is here and I gave all these prayers to my Lord. Our Father in heaven saved my child. You know, but the other two mothers, they lost their kids and the other teachers that died. You know, those people are suffering. Like, I'm suffering. I'm very sorry for them. I'm very sorry that they lost the people. They love the ones. And you have a message for the people in power. Yes, the people in power. Let's make a change. Let's make happen. Let's make, you know, let's just not hear about this. Who wants to just hear about this? We've got to change it. We've got to make it happen, you know? And Doug, Doug, I hear you're not a registered Democrat, but you now say it doesn't matter what side of the aisle you're on when it comes to this issue. What change do you want to see now that it has affected your family? You know, common sense, you know, I think a first step would just be metal detectors in schools, you know, make a budget, make a plan. And the people that say, well, we've never really done stuff like that before, I don't care. You know, they didn't have metal detectors at airports at one time, you know, they didn't have metal detectors at courthouses. They, you know, I think that if a child knew that he would, would get caught, the likelihood of him trying would be, they may, there may be another target, but it wouldn't be us having to worry about schools being hardened, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that Doug has said it so eloquently, which is we just need to apply common sense. And look, I think for far too long on the issue of gun violence, some people have been pushing a really false choice to suggest you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away. I'm in favor of the Second Amendment and I'm in favor of assault weapons bans, universal background checks, red flag laws. And these are just common sense. These are just common sense. I thought it was so powerful at the convention when you said, you have guns, no, at the debate. I'm a gun owner, Tim Walz is a gun. I did not know that. And I thought that was wrong. If somebody breaks in my house they're getting shot. Yes, yes. I hear that. I hear that. Probably should not have said that. But my staff will deal with that later. But you have been a gun owner for a while. Yes, I have. Yes. But, but, but here's, here's my point, Oprah, is that I'm not trying to take everyone's guns away. I believe in the Second Amendment. But we have to agree that, look, I did last fall a college tour with college age young people. So I also did trade schools and packed audience every time in their auditorium. And I would ask, please raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade you had to endure an active shooter drill. Almost every hand went up. It was bone chilling. This is the way our kids are living. And think about it. You know, I grew up, we had fire drills only. Well, I grew up in California. We all said earthquake drills. But the fact that our children are sitting in a classroom where they should be fulfilling their God given potential and exploring the wonders of the world. And some part of their brain realizes somebody could bust through that classroom door with a, with a weapon, with an assault weapon. And, and let's all agree that the trauma, so many children, even those who have not directly experienced the tragedy. Just being in the environment. Just being in the environment. I cannot tell you the number of young people who, I mean, our kids had active shooter drills. That they're concerned that there might be somebody who would kill them while they are at school. This is not the sign of a civil society. And we, it doesn't have to be this way. It does not have to be this way. But we need to have the courage to act. I mean, look, my opponent when he was told and knew about a shooting of a young girl. You know what he said? Get over it. Get over it. No, we're not getting over it. No. And to the point everyone should have a sense of collective responsibility for the children of our community. Yes. And understand their right to live and be safe. I have personally prosecuted homicide cases. I know I've, I've seen autopsies. I've seen autopsies. I've seen what these weapons do to the human body. And we've got to agree that in particular when we're talking about something like an assault weapon, it's literally designed to be a tool of war. It has no place on the streets of a civil society. It's designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly. And there are things we can do. Thankfully over the last three years we've done some, but it is common sense. It just seems like common sense. We would see this. We would see this. I think so. And I think that the majority of Americans agree with you that we do not want assault weapons in the hands of children and other people who have no business with those types of weapons. Right. Right. We know this is true. So we thank you Natalie and your family for being here. And good luck in that marching band this year. I hear you're going to go out for the marching band still. Thank you for inviting us. We are very unfortunately as I've said moment for us, but I wanted to make sure that, you know, we came because we needed to be heard. And we needed to, you know, change has to be made it and we ready to fight for this. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. We want to hear what's going on in another battleground state. Tracy is a regional organizing director in Nevada. Tracy, tell us how things are going for you. Hi. Hi everybody. I'm Tracy Lee, a regional organizing director in Nevada. I am the silver state this year because there's so much on the line from healthcare to lowering costs. These issues impact all of us. My team and I have been building relationships with voters across this state because here in Nevada, we know that enthusiasm alone does not win campaigns. Organizing does. So all of you watching tonight can become organizers, whether you talk to your sister, a roommate or a grandparent about why you're so excited to vote for Vice President Harris. You are organizing and energizing other supporters. So please go to go.com. LaHarris.com to find ways to help and enjoy the rest of tonight's event and let's get to work. Let's get to work. Let's do something. Meryl Streep. Hello. You and I. I'm Meryl Streep. You and I talked about this moment. Hi. Hi. How are you feeling? How are you feeling about the momentum? Oh, man. This, um, this has been overwhelming to have the privilege to sit in the same room as you. This has been overwhelming to have the privilege to sit in and listen to the testimony of people here. Um, hello, President Harris. Yeah. Yeah. 47 days. 47 days. Yes. From my mouth to God's ear. And hello, all brothers. I think the word of the day has been preventable. Preventable. All of this. The surround of hatred and venom and toxicity and, um, encouraging some segment of Americans to hate others. Segment of Americans. It's just crazy. And nobody wants it. We're done. That's right. We're done with it. Um, I'm just. I wanted to ask you. I can't believe I have this opportunity. Um, I probably never will again. Um, if I have a little Debbie Downer moment because actually I think you're going to win. I'm sure you're going to win. I think. Yeah. But what happens when you win? And he's going to win.

I'm going to win. I'm going to win. I'm going to win. I'm going to win. I'm going to win. We love our country. We take pride in the privilege of being American. And this is a moment where we can and must come together as Americans, understanding we have so much more in common than what separates us. Let's come together with the character that we are so proud of about who we are, which is we are an optimistic people. We are an optimistic people. Americans by character are people who have dreams and ambitions and aspirations. We believe in what is possible. We believe in what can be. And we believe in fighting for that. That's how we came into being because the people before us understood that one of the greatest expressions for the love of our country, one of the greatest expressions of patriotism is to fight for the ideals of who we are, which includes freedom to make decisions about your own body, freedom to be safe from gun violence, freedom to have access to the ballot box, freedom to be who you are and just be, to love who you love openly and with pride, freedom to just be. And that's who we are. We believe in all that. And so this is a moment where we stand knowing what we are fighting for. We're not fighting against. It's what we're fighting for. Thank you. Thank you.

2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"Hi! So welcome to my.. Oprah! Hello! Madam Vice President. Hello. Welcome to Michigan. It's so good to be back in Governor. Thank you for everything you are and everything you do for the state. Thank you. Well, thank you. Can you see this? We have a thousand screens here. Oh my goodness. Representing people from all over the country. Hi everyone. Can you feel? Can you feel? Can you feel it? Can you feel? The joy rising in here? I can and I have to tell you there's so much that I love about our campaign because it really is about the people. And I look around at these screens, Oprah. I look at who's in the room and this is America. This is. This is America. You know, I was saying with a group of friends earlier, I think in this moment where we've dealt with so much that I think is quite exhausting around powerful forces that would try and divide us and try us to have us as Americans pointing fingers at each other. Yes. That this movement that is about reminding each other that we have so much more in common than what separates us is so critically important. And this is about the strength of who we are as Americans. And this movement that we're in about, as I like to say, seeing in the face of a stranger, a neighbor. Yes, yes, yes, yes. An extension of love thy neighbor that you literally in the face of a stranger see a neighbor. Yes. And approach each other with that level of dignity and grace and kindness. Well, that's exactly what happened with the win with black women. I know you've known Jo Tate for many years. Thank you, my dear. That's exactly what happened. She started it. Is that the fact? They just started it. So it had to be careful. It had to be called. And then it said, let's open the door. Let's open the door and invite everybody else in. And everybody actually came. Organically. Yes. Organically. Like, this is the beauty of our country. There's so much at stake in this election. And ultimately, the question before us is what kind of country do we want to live in? And the beauty of the democracy, as long as we can hold on to it.",chunk_1,395
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"The beauty of a democracy is each of us has the power. Each of us has the power to answer that question. That's right. Everybody on this call and beyond has the power. But can I just start with this? Yes, please. I have to say this, because in all of my private conversations, Gail, and I've said this 100 times, and everybody is saying it, you all have said it. I know you have. It seems to us that something happened to you. The moment Joe Biden, President Biden, stepped aside and withdrew his candidacy, that a veil or something dropped, and you just stepped into your power. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then the next week, I saw you walking in the thing. And I said, what happened to you? You know, we each have those moments in our lives where it's time to step up. Time to step up. Time to step up. You know? Well, the moment you heard, I mean, I really have been saying to people it felt like a veil dropped, and you sort of stepped through that veil. Did that actually? Did you feel like that? I felt a sense of responsibility, to be honest with you. And with that comes a sense of purpose. But I mean, we're all here, and you all are taking time out of your busy lives. Everyone here. Everyone on the screen. Because there really is so much at stake. You know, I have spent the majority of my career being concerned about the well-being of other people. Yeah. As I've said, my career is a prosecutor. I never looked at a victim or a witness and asked them, are you a Republican or a Democrat? The only thing I've asked them is, are you OK? Are you OK? I know when I heard that. You know? Touch me. And traveling this country and knowing what is at stake in terms of fundamental freedoms, what's at stake in terms of fighting against hate and those efforts to divide us. And I do know that I'm in a position to do something about it. So I felt a great responsibility. And the incredible power of the people, right, who, I'm not the only leader in this.",chunk_2,399
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"We're all leaders in this. This is so much bigger than me. It's about who we are as Americans. And it's about making clear what we stand for. And what we stand for is it is about the ideals upon which we were founded, including the importance of freedom and the importance of independence and the importance of dignity and purpose. But it is also about what we stand for in terms of our values. I think of it this way. I think a lot boils down to values. I just said values are on the line here. It does. I mean, think about it, Oprah. The idea that some would suggest, and that my opponent suggests, which is that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. Come on. The real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. And it's important for us to articulate that. You know, ever since the debate, we feel for our fellow citizens in Springfield. Do you not think about the fellow citizens in Springfield, Ohio, the Haitian families, the non-Haitian families, everybody having to deal with this lie that has endangered the lives of Haitian people and anybody who looks Haitian. Everybody in America feels for that. And also, everybody in America, left, right, middle, has concerns about immigration. And I'm told that Justin, Justin, where are you in the audience? Justin? Hello. In the audience. Hello, Madam Vice President. You live in Michigan? Yes, ma'am. Don't you love saying hello, Madam Vice President? I do. What's your question? It's an immigration question. So you, when you become president, what would be your specific steps? Yeah, of course. What would be your specific steps to strengthening the border? So it's a wonderful and important question. I, you know, my background was as a prosecutor. And I was also the elected attorney general for two terms of a border state. So this is not a theoretical issue for me. This is something I've actually worked on. I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings.",chunk_3,361
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"I take very seriously the importance of having a secure border and ensuring the safety of the American people. Sadly, where we are now can be traced most recently back to the fact that when the United States Congress, members of the Congress, including some of the most conservative Republicans, came up with a border security bill. And here's what that border security bill would have done. It would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border. And let me tell you, those border agents are working around the clock. It would have just been about giving them some support and relief, which is probably why the border agents actually endorsed the bill. It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl. And I'm looking at people from all over the country here. So I don't need to tell the folks who are watching this what fentanyl has done to families, to kids in our country, and the need to take seriously stemming the flow coming into our country and addressing that extraordinary and tragic issue in terms of its effect. The bill would have allowed us to have more resources to prosecute transnational criminal organizations. And it would have been part of the solution. And Donald Trump called up those folks and said, don't put that bill on the floor for a vote. He blocked the bill. And you know why? Because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he has put his personal political security before border security. Because understand, even in the intervening months, what that bill would have done to give support to folks who care about this issue. And this, again, gets to the point about what does leadership really look like? And is it about you or is it about the people? Is it about running on problems or fixing problems? My work and my career has always been about saying, let's fix problems. Let's address the needs. Because we know it's within our capacity to do that. So to answer Justin's question, now that that bill has gone and hasn't passed, will you reintroduce that? Absolutely.",chunk_4,370
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"And when I am elected president of the United States, I will make sure that bill gets to my desk. And I will sign it into law. Thank you, Justin. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Listen to this. A majority of young Americans, 18 to 34, say that the cost of living is their top issue ahead of the election. Let's take a look. Groceries are extremely expensive right now. I don't understand how people are affording life right now. For so many Americans, the high cost of living is their top concern this election. Rachel, we have $435 to last us to the end of the month. OK? What? In Philadelphia, Rachel and Garrett say they have to watch every penny. When I think of middle class, I think about people who are able to just get up and go and do things within their means and not extravagant things, but be able to get up and go to dinner whenever they want, or maybe take that trip, that long weekend trip. We don't have that luxury. By a long shot, her tax plan is phenomenal, no glaze. Kamala Harris just delivered her new economic plan. And boy, oh boy, is it good for small business owners. Holy shit, you guys. Kamala Harris is going to announce tomorrow a $25,000 tax credit for first time home buyers. When I am elected president, I will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans. Well, Rachel and Garrett are joining us on Zoom from Pennsylvania. And I understand your sister and brother-in-law moved in, and you're hoping to save money to have a second child. That's right. Hi, Oprah. Hi, Madam Vice President. It's nice to be with you all. Yes. And so what did you want to say to the vice president? So Madam Vice President, we are like many, many young Americans just experiencing a very high cost of living. We ended up giving up our apartment, moving in with our parents, who were so gracious to take us in for over a year so that we could save money and ultimately buy a home, because that's what we thought the American dream was, to get married and buy a home and have a baby.",chunk_5,385
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"And now here we are and our mortgage is incredibly higher than what we thought it would be. And my sister and our brother-in-law are living with us right now so that they can hopefully one day do the same. And while it's beneficial for us because they help us pay off some of our mortgage, it's also beneficial for them because they can save on cheaper rent. But we really would love to know what your plan is to help lower the cost of living. Yeah. First of all, thank you both for being here. And yours is a story I hear around the country as I travel. And in terms of both rightly having the right to have aspirations and dreams and ambitions for your family and working hard and finding that the American dream is for this generation and so many recently far more elusive than it's been. And we need to deal with that. And there are a number of ways. One is bringing down the cost of everyday necessities, including groceries. So that's why I'm taking on, for example, price gouging, which is when most companies and corporations are good. But for those bad ones, they take advantage of people, especially during a pandemic or extreme weather. And they end up jacking up prices. And there needs to be accountability and consequence for that. So I'm going to be taking on price gouging. But it's also about dealing with what we need to do around home ownership. So as someone mentioned during this film, look, I grew up a child of a mother who worked very hard. She raised me and my sister. And she saved up. And by the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy a home. And we grew up actually for a long time in an apartment on top of a child care center that was owned by the woman we called our second mother because she helped my mother raise us. And she was a small business owner, Michelle Tyn. So I'll bring all of this together to tell you the way I think about it is one, when people work hard and have a dream of buying a home, we should give you the opportunity to be able to do that, which is why part of my plan is for first-time homeowners, buyers, to have a $25,000 down payment assistance to buy your first home.",chunk_6,409
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"Because people just need to be able to get their foot in the door and then you'll do the hard work. Part of my plan is what we need to do to support small businesses because my second mother was a small business owner and I love our small businesses and our small business owners. They are not only business leaders, they are community leaders. They mentor, they hire locally. And we have so many entrepreneurs in our country who have great ideas, incredible work ethic, but not necessarily access to capital because not everybody like my opponent was handed $400 million on a silver plate that he filed bankruptcy six times on. And so part of my plan is to give startup small businesses a $50,000 tax deduction to start up their small business. Right now it's $5,000. Nobody can start a small business with $5,000. So that's part of my plan. That's a teeny-tiny business. That's a business in a tiny business. It's a concept of a business. Right? Yes. You know where I go. That's right. It's still on paper with the $5,000. It just hasn't happened. Part of the, to speak to you guys and your family and your dreams is what we need to do around giving middle class families tax breaks. And so part of my plan is also to extend and expand the child tax credit to $6,000 so that you can, in the first year of your child's life, have the resources to be able to buy a crib and a car seat and clothes for your baby knowing that's such an extraordinarily important time in their development. And you shouldn't have to worry about how you're going to take care of their basic needs. All of this and more is part of what I plan to build and I call it an opportunity economy. And it's basically about creating opportunities, knowing so many people have the ambition, have the aspirations, are working hard, but just need opportunity to reach their goals and their dreams. I saw you smiling with that $25,000 credit for the home. I saw that smile on your face and the $6,000. Thank you all so much. I want to just introduce Jude to Shelby, who's also in our virtual audience.",chunk_7,383
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"Thank you guys. Shelby from Virginia, who's also struggling with the cost of living. Tell us your story, Shelby. Why? Hi. Hi, Madam Vice President. Hi, I'm Brad. I'm 24 years old. I'm a graduate student living with my parents and I want to move out next year and potentially buy a home. And I'm concerned about the affordability of one with the extra cost and bills I'm paying now along with the bills and costs I will pay in the future too. And so everything just has a cost and everything is so expensive. And so I'm worried about my capacity and how I'm able to fully support myself once I do live independently. You sound like one of my daughter girls from South Africa graduated. She was like, I hate adulting. I hate adulting. This adulting isn't going so well. Yes. Well, so first of all, congratulations on all the success you've already achieved. And it is your story and the story of our friends before you is really, that's the American story, right? You are working hard. You have goals. You have ambitions. And so part of it is again, the $25,000 down payment assistance. Part of it is what we need to do to also push back against a very different vision for our country because look in this election, there are two very different visions for our country. One for me that is focused on the future, including you and another that is focused on the past. What Donald Trump, what my opponent plans on doing for the economy is doing what he did the last time he was president and giving another tax break for billionaires and the biggest corporations that would add $5 trillion to our deficit and get this. He plans on doing what I call a Trump sales tax, which is basically he's going to put a 20% tax on everyday necessities. That economists have estimated will cost the average American $4,000 more a year, which is why Goldman Sachs, which is why Moody's, which is why Wharton School of Business, which is why 16 Nobel laureates have collectively determined after analyzing our plans one mind would strengthen the economy, his would weaken it.",chunk_8,373
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"Two, that on his plan he would actually blow up inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So when you think about the cost of living, my approach is about lifting you up. His would be about actually weakening our economy. And I feel very strongly when an individual, when a small business, when a family, when the middle class is strong, America is strong. Amen to that. Amen to that. Thank you, Shelby. Thank you, Rachel and Garrett. So the Harris campaign kicked off the Fighting for Reproductive Freedom Bus Tour to support the fundamental right for women to make decisions about our own bodies. And here is a short tape on that. I did something that nobody thought was possible. I got rid of Roe v. Wade. After Roe v. Wade was overturned, Tennessee put forth a ban immediately. That banned all abortion with no exceptions. Abortion bans are not for life. They are pro-poverty and pro-invulability. It's been over two years since a five to four ruling by the Supreme Court ended Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that provided nearly 50 years of abortion rights across the United States. Our body! Since then, abortions have been banned in over a dozen states. Many women and doctors say the limits on reproductive rights have forced them into unimaginable situations. These policies do not reflect evidence-based medical practice. They do not keep my patient safe. According to the gender equity policy, women who live in states where abortion is banned are up to three times more likely to die during pregnancy, during childbirth, or soon after giving birth. I nearly died all because of Donald Trump's Supreme Court justices overturning Roe v. Wade. So for the millions of you who watched the Democratic National Convention, you will remember Hadley DeVall telling her incredibly powerful story. In case you didn't see it, here's just a brief look. Growing up, I was an all-American girl. Varsity soccer captain, cheerleading captain, homecoming queen, and survivor. I was raped by my stepfather after years of sexual abuse.",chunk_9,349
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"At age 12, I took my first pregnancy test, and it was positive. Hadley is here. Stand up, Hadley. Thank you. I can tell you, we are all standing up because we are so impressed by your courage to stand up and share your story. Where did that come from, the strength to do this? Because I'm sure you thought long and hard before deciding to go public with your story. When Roe v. Wade was overturned, I woke up with a harsh reality of my abuse was over but my story is not. And I just could not fathom thinking about the other Hadleys out there that don't have that choice, that don't have somebody to go to. So being able to find courage and be the light for them, that's really what I do it for. And so what do you want to say to other people who are voting in this election regarding what happened to you and what that means? You can't wait until it's too late to care about reproductive health care, because then it's too late. And when it affects you, it hits and you can't deny it. You can't look at someone with a story like mine and say it didn't happen. And there are more people like me out there and there are going to be so many more who deserve their options. They deserve their choices. Let's get involved. We have someone who's willing to hear us at a level like never before. We have someone who wants to know what we want in this country. We have someone who wants to lift up our voice. And we need to show out and show up for her just like she's showing out and showing up for us. Alright. Is there something you want to say to Madam Vice President? Madam Vice President, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for seeing us, for hearing us when the Supreme Court won't. Thank you for fighting and really showing us that life is not about the hard things that you go through. It's not about down. Even when you're the underdog, especially when you're the underdog. You stand up and you stand tall and you give me so much hope and so much strength. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Madam Vice President, for coming all this way.",chunk_10,398

This week, the case of a young woman who lost her life after the abortion ban took place in Georgia made national headlines. Amber's case came to light through the reporting of journalist Kavita Serana with ProPublica. And so listen to her story. Two years ago, 28-year-old Amber Nicole Thurman, a medical assistant and a single mother to a six-year-old boy, found out she was pregnant. Amber had just secured her own apartment and was thinking about going to nursing school. She made the decision to terminate her pregnancy. A strict abortion ban had recently taken place in her home state of Georgia, which caused Amber to travel to North Carolina for the procedure. Traffic made her miss the appointment, so the clinic gave her medication, what are known as abortion pills. Once back home, Amber experienced profuse bleeding, vomiting, severe pain. She eventually passed out. Her boyfriend called for an ambulance. At the Georgia hospital, Amber's condition deteriorated quickly. In a rare occurrence, it was discovered her body had not expelled all the fetal tissue and an infection was spreading. Official Georgia State Medical Expert analysis of her case says Amber should have received a life-saving D&C, but doctors waited 20 hours before deciding to take her to surgery. Amber's blood pressure had taken a dive, or organs had started failing. In the operating room, her heart stopped. On the way to surgery, Amber's last words to her mother were, Promise me you'll take care of my son. Amber's mother, Shannette and older sisters CJ and Andrika are here, and they wanted to be here tonight to speak out for the first time. Ms. Shannette, what do you want us to know about Amber's story? Initially, I did not want the public to know my pain. I wanted to go through in silence, but I realized that it was selfish. I want y'all to know Amber was not a statistic. She was loved by a family, a strong family, and we would have done whatever to get my baby, our baby, the help that she needed.",chunk_11,360
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"When ProPublica came to my home, I pushed them away. No, no, no, but Cavitea, she kept, she was persistent. She said, it was something that you needed to know. You have to hear me. Women around the world, people around the world need to know that this was preventable. Two years later, after speaking with my daughters, because I lost strength, I lost hope, you're looking at a mother that is broken. The worst pain ever that a mother, that a parent could ever feel, her father and myself and the family, you're looking at it. Well, we appreciate so deeply you being here. We're all watching you hear that tape in those words. We know how re-traumatizing that is and the strength it takes for you to be here to tell your story. And we deeply appreciate it. And I have to ask you, as her sisters, how are you coping? And what does knowing that this could have been prevented, how does that sit with you? How do you cope with that on a daily basis? I mean, it's heartbreaking. That was my baby sister. I love my baby sister. I'm beyond hurt, disappointed. I feel guilty. I wish I could have helped her because she was suffering. And we had no idea we trusted them to take care of her. And they just let her die because of some stupid abortion ban. They treated her like she was just another member. They didn't care for her as if she was their daughter or their granddaughter. And she's not here. She'll never come back. Yeah. Andrika, what do you want to say? I want to say that it is very disheartening that my sister was allowed to suffer for 20 hours. She suffered. It was nothing that we could do to help her. We trusted the healthcare professionals to do their job and save her, but they failed her. Well, I think the most powerful thing that you've said here, Ms. Jeanette, is that your daughter is not a statistic. She had a life. She was loved by her sisters, loved by her family, loved by those who knew her, and she's not just a statistic. And we are happy to speak her name tonight in this room talking about what this country needs in terms of reproductive rights and freedom.",chunk_12,394
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"What do you want to say, Madam Vice President? I'm just so sorry. And the courage that you all have shown is extraordinary because also you just learned about how it is that she died. And.. They just recently learned. How? Yeah. And Amber's mom shared with me that the word over and over again in her mind is preventable. Yeah. Preventable. That word keeps coming to her. And this story is a story that is sadly not the only story of what has been happening since these bands have taken place. And, you know, so just to step back in terms of how we got here, the former president chose three members of the United States Supreme Court. With the intention that they would overdo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did as he intended, and in state after state, including yours, these abortion bands have been passed that criminalize healthcare providers in a couple of states prison for life opera. Prison for life in a couple of states for a doctor or a nurse who provides healthcare. And so it seems very apparent that.. Even when the mother's life is in danger. See, here's the problem with that. Here's the problem with that. So is she on death's door before you actually decide to give her help? Mm-hmm. That's the problem. Is that what we're saying? Yeah. That you've got to prove you're on death's door. Like, literally a doctor or a nurse has to say, she might die any minute. Better give her now care. Because otherwise I might go to prison for life in some cases. Think about what we're doing in terms of saying that certain people who are in these state houses and then starting with the former president of the United States think they're in a better position than a doctor or a nurse to determine when their patient needs medical care. This literally in an amber story highlights the fact that among everything that is wrong with these bans and what has happened in terms of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, it's a healthcare crisis. It's a healthcare crisis that affects the patient and the profession. And going back to Hadley's story, and Hadley, you've been so remarkable in telling your story and being so strong in the way you do it.",chunk_13,393

I see somebody else on the screen. Julia Roberts. Hi, Julia. Hi, Julia. I heard you were so excited you wanted to be here tonight. Why? Well, first of all, Oprah, thank you for hosting this because I guess if I started a voting club, it would be conversationalists for Kamala. Because to talk, to listen, to be heard, to have this back and forth is so unique in this campaign to beautiful, wonderful Kamala Harris, who I've had the good fortune of knowing. And I am a mother of two kids. This is their first chance to vote in an election. And I couldn't be more excited for them to have the legacy to say that their first vote they ever cast for president was for you. I have just chills saying that out loud.

In fact, you know, they are in college, so we will be separated on the great day. But in spirit, united always for what we believe in and what we, you know, I feel like it's interesting.

And then I also really want to remind everybody it hasn't been mentioned, but voting up and down the ballot is exciting. Your freedom and your daily life are all the way up and down that ballot. People are policies and we need the right people in all areas, all positions. And then I would like to say to you two women, thank you for what you represent, because as a 52-year-old childless woman, I want to say to the people who think that a woman's worth is measured in her baby count. I mean, shout out to all the amazing mothers, but the childless women have been mothering the world in elevating culture as Godmothers, teachers, mentors, sisters and friends, and lists goes on.

It's 10.30 a.m. at Rob Elementary in Uvalde. The school is recognizing my 10-year-old daughter Lexi for receiving all A's. 30 minutes later, a gunman murders her, 18 classmates and two teachers. In the last 25 years, there have been 417 school shootings in the United States, and more than 383,000 students have experienced gun violence while at school. More children and adolescents are killed by guns each year than anything else nationwide.

I've had intruder drills and fire drills and stuff. In my old schools we had a fire drill at Apalachee. But it was the first two months of the school year we hadn't had an intruder drill yet. So we weren't even completely sure where to go in the classroom. We all just.. I remember being like huddled. So I was watching your mother even just when that tape was coming on.

I want to just finish what the experience, you do not know what feels until it's you. All those numbers that you show on the TV, a lot of people are here are mothers. What are we doing about this? What are we doing? Let's make sure that everybody listens and makes sure that everybody hears. The whole world needs to hear that we women have our children, we have a job. That job is to protect our children. That job is to protect our nation. That job is to protect our country. We cannot let that. We cannot leave. We cannot let that go home. We have to stop it. You know, I was asking earlier where are those people? All the other shooting, where are they? They needed to make a noise. I'm ready to make a noise about this and I'm ready to stop it because no one, no one knows what feels when you keep finding a child. When you call her, you call her, just not answering. When I went through it, you know, it's just me that knows it. And I'm so sorry for those that lost, that the children actually died. I can actually hug my child. My child is here and I gave all these prayers to my Lord. Our Father in heaven saved my child. You know, but the other two mothers, they lost their kids and the other teachers that died.",chunk_17,434

I'm very sorry for them. I'm very sorry that they lost the people. They love the ones. And you have a message for the people in power. Yes, the people in power. Let's make a change. Let's make happen. Let's make, you know, let's just not hear about this. Who wants to just hear about this? We've got to change it. We've got to make it happen, you know? And Doug, Doug, I hear you're not a registered Democrat, but you now say it doesn't matter what side of the aisle you're on when it comes to this issue. What change do you want to see now that it has affected your family? You know, common sense, you know, I think a first step would just be metal detectors in schools, you know, make a budget, make a plan. And the people that say, well, we've never really done stuff like that before, I don't care. You know, they didn't have metal detectors at airports at one time, you know, they didn't have metal detectors at courthouses. They, you know, I think that if a child knew that he would, would get caught, the likelihood of him trying would be, they may, there may be another target, but it wouldn't be us having to worry about schools being hardened, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that Doug has said it so eloquently, which is we just need to apply common sense. And look, I think for far too long on the issue of gun violence, some people have been pushing a really false choice to suggest you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away. I'm in favor of the Second Amendment and I'm in favor of assault weapons bans, universal background checks, red flag laws. And these are just common sense. These are just common sense. I thought it was so powerful at the convention when you said, you have guns, no, at the debate. I'm a gun owner, Tim Walz is a gun. I did not know that. And I thought that was wrong. If somebody breaks in my house they're getting shot. Yes, yes. I hear that. I hear that. Probably should not have said that.",chunk_18,387
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"But my staff will deal with that later. But you have been a gun owner for a while. Yes, I have. Yes. But, but, but here's, here's my point, Oprah, is that I'm not trying to take everyone's guns away. I believe in the Second Amendment. But we have to agree that, look, I did last fall a college tour with college age young people. So I also did trade schools and packed audience every time in their auditorium. And I would ask, please raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade you had to endure an active shooter drill. Almost every hand went up. It was bone chilling. This is the way our kids are living. And think about it. You know, I grew up, we had fire drills only. Well, I grew up in California. We all said earthquake drills. But the fact that our children are sitting in a classroom where they should be fulfilling their God given potential and exploring the wonders of the world. And some part of their brain realizes somebody could bust through that classroom door with a, with a weapon, with an assault weapon. And, and let's all agree that the trauma, so many children, even those who have not directly experienced the tragedy. Just being in the environment. Just being in the environment. I cannot tell you the number of young people who, I mean, our kids had active shooter drills. That they're concerned that there might be somebody who would kill them while they are at school. This is not the sign of a civil society. And we, it doesn't have to be this way. It does not have to be this way. But we need to have the courage to act. I mean, look, my opponent when he was told and knew about a shooting of a young girl. You know what he said? Get over it. Get over it. No, we're not getting over it. No. And to the point everyone should have a sense of collective responsibility for the children of our community. Yes. And understand their right to live and be safe. I have personally prosecuted homicide cases. I know I've, I've seen autopsies. I've seen autopsies. I've seen what these weapons do to the human body.",chunk_19,385
2024-09-19,Interview,"Harris participated in a livestreamed interview with Oprah Winfrey in Farmington Hills, Michigan",chunk,"And we've got to agree that in particular when we're talking about something like an assault weapon, it's literally designed to be a tool of war. It has no place on the streets of a civil society. It's designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly. And there are things we can do. Thankfully over the last three years we've done some, but it is common sense. It just seems like common sense. We would see this. We would see this. I think so. And I think that the majority of Americans agree with you that we do not want assault weapons in the hands of children and other people who have no business with those types of weapons. Right. Right. We know this is true. So we thank you Natalie and your family for being here. And good luck in that marching band this year. I hear you're going to go out for the marching band still. Thank you for inviting us. We are very unfortunately as I've said moment for us, but I wanted to make sure that, you know, we came because we needed to be heard.

My team and I have been building relationships with voters across this state because here in Nevada, we know that enthusiasm alone does not win campaigns. Organizing does.

Because we're tired of all that division and hate they're pushing. We here know the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And that's what our campaign is about. Understanding that this is a people powered campaign, that this is a campaign about building community, building coalitions, reminding us all that we are all in this together. And that we're going to be good and alright. We're in this together. Which is why Democrats, Republicans and independents are supporting our campaign. Because they want a president, we want a president who works for all the American people. And I promise you that is the kind of president I will be. I promise that. Now many of you know my background. My entire career I have fought for the people. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland I stood up for women and children against predators who abuse them. As Attorney General of California I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure because of predatory lending practices. I stood up for veterans and students who were being scammed by the big for profit colleges. And for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due. And for seniors facing elder abuse. And as president I will fight on behalf of all communities and all Americans and together we will build a brighter future for our nation. Together we will build a future where we build what I call an opportunity economy. So every American has the opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a small business. And I will tell you I love our small businesses. For the small business leaders who are here can you raise your hand. Our small business leaders are extraordinary. So you know growing up before our mother could afford to buy a house we lived in an apartment above a childcare center. It was owned by a woman by the name of Mrs. Shelton and she helped raise my sister Maya and me because my mother worked long days and sometimes on weekends. We called Mrs. Shelton our second mother and she was a small business owner. So from childhood I have known the character and work ethic of our small business owners. And I know small business owners are the backbone of America's economy. Which is why my plan offers a new way forward and will give a $50,000 tax deduction to help entrepreneurs start their small businesses. I also know we need to build more housing in America. You know my mother saved up for years and when I was a teenager she was finally able to buy her first home. I know what that dream is like. I know what it is like for people to work hard and to save up and have a dream that is about the dignity of their work and an investment in their future, the future of their family and investment in the pride they so rightly deserve because of their hard work. But right now in the affordable housing issue, look, we have a shortage of housing in America and it's contributing to driving up prices. So with my plan we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term. And provide first time home buyers with $25,000 in down payment assistance so they can just get their foot in the door. Because unlike my opponent who was basically handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times, we know that most people need to just have the opportunity to actually get their foot in the door to achieve their dream and their dream. So we have to bear aspirations. We also need to lower the cost of living because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday necessities like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. So I have a plan to lower costs on everything ranging from health care to groceries including taking on corporate price gouging. And my plan includes giving a tax cut to 100 million Americans including $6,000 by expanding the child tax credit for the first year of a child's life to help young and new parents buy a car seat, a crib, baby clothes in that most significant phase of their development. And all of this is to say I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class and I have never forgotten where I come from and I never will. And I never will. Now Donald Trump, well he has a different plan and in many ways you've heard me say before he is an unserious man. But the consequences of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious. Extremely serious. Just Google Project 2025. By the way, can you believe they put that thing in writing? I mean they put it in writing, they had it bound and they handed it out. And if you get your hands on it or just Google it, let me tell you it's a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he were elected president again. If Donald Trump, well you know what, the courts will take care of that. Let's take care of him in November. We'll take care of him in November. How about that? But if you look at what he's up to, Donald Trump will give billionaires and big corporations massive tax cuts. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. And he wants to impose what I call a Trump sales tax because here's the thing. What he is proposing would be a 20% tax on everyday necessities, basic necessities which economists estimate will cost most working families more than $4,000 a year extra. Think about that. And on top of all of that, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. Remember he tried 60 times when he was president. In fact, together with Tammy, I was a United States Senator on the floor, I don't know where she is right now, but she'll remember and we've talked about this. We were on the floor of the United States Senate in the middle of the night when one of those votes was up when they were trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And we were all standing around after we all voted to protect the Affordable Care Act. And we were all standing around and then the big wooden doors to the Senate well opened and in walked the late great John McCain. Remember that? And he said no you don't. He said no you don't. Remember that? But we were up against those kinds of attacks when he was president last time and as he said in the debate, he intends to replace it but has no plan. In fact, he has quote, concepts of a plan. No actual plan, concepts. So aside from that being laughable, it's very serious because he's basically saying he would threaten the health insurance of 45 million people in our country based on a concept. And take us back. Remember those days when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions? Remember what that was like? Well, brother, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We will not go back. We are not going back. No, we are not. We will move forward. And just like Wisconsin State motto tells us forward is where we go. Forward is where we go. Because ours, ours is a fight for the future. And ours is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. Freedom. And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did exactly as he intended. And now in more than 20 states, we have Trump abortion bans, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. It is immoral. It is immoral. And let us agree. Let us agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. Not the government. Not the government. And yet, and yet in our debate, Donald Trump said that everyone wanted to overturn Roe. I have talked with folks who are here. I have talked with women around our country and the people who love them. Women are being denied care during miscarriages. Some only being treated once they developed sepsis. They didn't want this. And we know that women have died because of Trump abortion bans. I was with a mother and the two sisters of a woman who died because of Trump abortion bans just last night. You know, and her mother said the worst thing among the pain that she is experiencing is when she heard and reflects on what she was told that it was preventable. Preventable. And you know when that decision came down just over two years ago, we predicted this would happen. And it's preventable. You know, the young woman, she was a vibrant 28 year old young woman with a mother of a six year old son. Her name, Amber Nicole Thurman, who I promised her mother I will say her name every time. And so Amber was a medical assistant. She had just learned that she was accepted to nursing school. She had her whole future planned out. And her sisters and her mother were describing her to me and they said, you know, she had such light and she had ambition and she had drive and she was so proud that she had worked so hard and she was finally gaining independence that she found an apartment in a safe community. It had a little pool where her son could play and she was so proud. She was so proud and so hopeful. And then she discovered she was pregnant and she decided to have an abortion. But because of the Trump abortion ban in Georgia, she was forced to travel out of state to receive the health care that she needed. And when she returned to Georgia, she needed additional care. So she went to a hospital in Georgia. But under the Trump abortion ban, her doctors could have faced up to a decade in prison for providing Amber the care she needed. And so she waited for 20 excruciating hours she waited as she deteriorated. And then she reached such a state, a critical state, that the doctors finally operated and it was too late. And she died of substance. And recently medical experts determined that Amber's death was preventable, preventable. So understand what a law like this means, what these kinds of laws mean, these kinds of laws under Trump abortion bans. It means doctors may have to wait until the patient is at death's door before they take any action. Nobody wants that. What is he talking about? Nobody wants that. Are we saying we're going to craft now public health policy so that doctors only kick in when you're about to die? No. This is one example of what is happening around our country right now. And this is a health care crisis. And Donald Trump is the architect. So I will say to you, because of why we are here, we're going to get Tammy reelected to the United States Senate. And when Congress passes the bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. And across our nation, we are witnessing a full on assault on other hard fought, hard won fundamental rights and freedoms, like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to join a union, the freedom to love who you are, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free, the freedom to be free and love openly and with pride. So we know what we are up against. We are clear eyed about what we are up against. And we remember that generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now the baton is in our hands. Now it's in our hands. It's in our hands. And so much is on the line in this election. And this is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher. And remember two months ago the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. But think about that. Think about what that means. So before at least there was some threat of consequence. And now the court has made this decision. Think about that. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. He who has vowed to be a dictator on day one. He who has called for quote, the termination of the Constitution of the United States of America. And let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. Never again. Never again. So Wisconsin, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And we understand the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on earth. The privilege and pride of being an American. And I do believe that it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. So Madison, Election Day, yes, in 46 days and early voting has already started in some states. Early voting in Wisconsin starts in just 32 days. And in fact, many of you may have already received your mail-in ballots. Check this out. In person early voting begins in Virginia and Minnesota today. Today. And don't we love Tim Walls? He's so good. He's so good. So all that to say, the election is basically here. It's basically here and we have work to do to energize, to organize and to mobilize and to remind everyone, your vote is your voice. And your voice is your power. And never let anyone take your power from you. So Madison, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you.",full,4945

And my plan includes giving a tax cut to 100 million Americans including $6,000 by expanding the child tax credit for the first year of a child's life to help young and new parents buy a car seat, a crib, baby clothes in that most significant phase of their development.",chunk_3,381

I come from the middle class and I have never forgotten where I come from and I never will. And I never will. Now Donald Trump, well he has a different plan and in many ways you've heard me say before he is an unserious man. But the consequences of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious. Extremely serious. Just Google Project 2025. By the way, can you believe they put that thing in writing? I mean they put it in writing, they had it bound and they handed it out. And if you get your hands on it or just Google it, let me tell you it's a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he were elected president again. If Donald Trump, well you know what, the courts will take care of that. Let's take care of him in November. We'll take care of him in November. How about that? But if you look at what he's up to, Donald Trump will give billionaires and big corporations massive tax cuts. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. And he wants to impose what I call a Trump sales tax because here's the thing. What he is proposing would be a 20% tax on everyday necessities, basic necessities which economists estimate will cost most working families more than $4,000 a year extra. Think about that. And on top of all of that, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. Remember he tried 60 times when he was president. In fact, together with Tammy, I was a United States Senator on the floor, I don't know where she is right now, but she'll remember and we've talked about this. We were on the floor of the United States Senate in the middle of the night when one of those votes was up when they were trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And we were all standing around after we all voted to protect the Affordable Care Act. And we were all standing around and then the big wooden doors to the Senate well opened and in walked the late great John McCain. Remember that? And he said no you don't.",chunk_4,389
2024-09-20,Rally,"Harris Campaign Rally in Madison, Wisconsin",chunk,"He said no you don't. Remember that? But we were up against those kinds of attacks when he was president last time and as he said in the debate, he intends to replace it but has no plan. In fact, he has quote, concepts of a plan. No actual plan, concepts. So aside from that being laughable, it's very serious because he's basically saying he would threaten the health insurance of 45 million people in our country based on a concept. And take us back. Remember those days when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions? Remember what that was like? Well, brother, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We will not go back. We are not going back. No, we are not. We will move forward. And just like Wisconsin State motto tells us forward is where we go. Forward is where we go. Because ours, ours is a fight for the future. And ours is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. Freedom. And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did exactly as he intended. And now in more than 20 states, we have Trump abortion bans, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. It is immoral. It is immoral. And let us agree. Let us agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. Not the government. Not the government. And yet, and yet in our debate, Donald Trump said that everyone wanted to overturn Roe. I have talked with folks who are here. I have talked with women around our country and the people who love them. Women are being denied care during miscarriages. Some only being treated once they developed sepsis. They didn't want this. And we know that women have died because of Trump abortion bans. I was with a mother and the two sisters of a woman who died because of Trump abortion bans just last night.",chunk_5,389

Preventable. And you know when that decision came down just over two years ago, we predicted this would happen. And it's preventable. You know, the young woman, she was a vibrant 28 year old young woman with a mother of a six year old son. Her name, Amber Nicole Thurman, who I promised her mother I will say her name every time. And so Amber was a medical assistant. She had just learned that she was accepted to nursing school. She had her whole future planned out. And her sisters and her mother were describing her to me and they said, you know, she had such light and she had ambition and she had drive and she was so proud that she had worked so hard and she was finally gaining independence that she found an apartment in a safe community. It had a little pool where her son could play and she was so proud. She was so proud and so hopeful. And then she discovered she was pregnant and she decided to have an abortion. But because of the Trump abortion ban in Georgia, she was forced to travel out of state to receive the health care that she needed. And when she returned to Georgia, she needed additional care. So she went to a hospital in Georgia. But under the Trump abortion ban, her doctors could have faced up to a decade in prison for providing Amber the care she needed. And so she waited for 20 excruciating hours she waited as she deteriorated. And then she reached such a state, a critical state, that the doctors finally operated and it was too late. And she died of substance. And recently medical experts determined that Amber's death was preventable, preventable. So understand what a law like this means, what these kinds of laws mean, these kinds of laws under Trump abortion bans.

And when Congress passes the bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly.

And let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. Never again. Never again. So Wisconsin, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country.

Thank you all. Thank you. You know, I just want to say thank you. I just want to say about Dr. Redick. You know, some of you may have seen I did an event last night with Oprah Winfrey. And that it highlighted so many tragic stories, but it also highlighted so many important issues, which is why everyone has taken time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. And it highlighted the importance of a Dr. Redick. Because the courage, Dr. Redick, that you are showing in the face of these arcane and immoral laws to stand so publicly and talk about your commitment to your oath and to the health and well-being of people who need to be seen and treated with dignity is so extraordinary. And I do believe in moments of crisis. The world has a way of revealing the heroes among us. And I would say Dr. Redick, you are one of them. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you to all of the elected and community leaders who have joined us today. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Everybody who is here.

And we know in America, freedom is not to be given. It is not to be bestowed. It is ours by right. It is ours by right. And that includes the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. Yes, we must trust women. And we all know how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court, the court of Thurgood and RBG, with the intention that they would overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. And now more than 20 states have Trump abortion bans, extremists that have passed laws that criminalize health care providers, doctors and nurses, and punished women. In two states of those states, they provide for prison for life. Prison for life for health care providers for simply providing reproductive care. The care they so earnestly and rightly believe must be delivered. All Trump abortion bans. And think about this. Many of these bans make no exception, even for rape and incest. Now many of you know I started my career as a prosecutor, specializing in crimes of violence against women and children. What many of you may not know is why. So when I was in high school, my best friend I learned was being molested by her step-father. And I said to her, look, you got to come and stay with us. I called my mother. She said, of course she doesn't. She came and she stayed with us. And so I made the decision early in my life that I wanted to do the work that was about protecting the most vulnerable among us and doing the work that was about giving them dignity in the process. And so, well, thank everybody here for being here, standing in solidarity around the importance of that. And so I say to you then from that experience and from the work that I've done, the idea that someone who survives a crime of violence to their body, a violation of their body, would not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That's immoral. That's immoral. And let us agree and I know we do. One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. If she chooses, if she chooses she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her mother, her husband, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, her mother, and every state in the south except Virginia. Think about that when you also combine that with what we know has been longstanding neglect around an issue like maternal mortality. Think about that when you compound that with what has been longstanding neglect of women in communities with a lack of the adequate resources they need for healthcare, prenatal, during their pregnancy, postpartum. Think about that. And these hypocrites want to start talking about this isn't the best interest of women and children. Well, where you been? Where you been when it comes to taking care of the women and children of America? Where you been? How dare they? How dare they? Come on. And we understand the impact of these bands and the horrific reality that women and families, their husbands, their partners, their parents, their children, are facing as a consequence every single day. Since Roe was overturned, I have met women who were refused care during a miscarriage, wanted to have a child, suffering a miscarriage. I met a woman, a woman I've actually met several, who were turned away from the emergency room. One early stages after the Dobs decision came down told me with tears, she was with her husband, about how only when she developed sepsis did she receive emergency care. Only when she developed sepsis did she receive emergency care. And now we know that at least two women, and those are only the stories we know. Here in the state of Georgia, died, died because of a Trump abortion ban. One, and we heard about her story last night, a vibrant 28 year old young woman. She was ambitious, you know, I talked with her mother and her sisters about her, and they described such an extraordinary life of a person. She was excited, she was working hard. She was a medical assistant. She was going to nursing school, raising her six year old son. She was really proud that she had finally worked so hard that she gained the independence. Her family was telling me that she was able to get an apartment and a gated community with a pool for her son to play in. She was so proud, and she was headed to nursing school. And her name, and we will speak her name, Amber Nicole Thurman. Amber Nicole Thurman. Amber Nicole Thurman. That's right. And she had her future all planned out, and it was her plan. You know, let's understand, just take pause on that for a moment. She had her plan, what she wanted to do for her son, for herself, for their future. And so when she discovered that she was pregnant, she decided she wanted to have an abortion. But because of the Trump abortion ban here in Georgia, she was forced to travel out of state to receive the health care that she needed. But when she returned to Georgia, she needed additional care. So she went to a hospital. But you see, under the Trump abortion ban, her doctors could have faced up to a decade in prison for providing Amber the care she needed. Understand what a law like this means. Doctors have to wait until the patient is at death door before they take action. You know, on the other side of my, you know, the other folks, Trump and his running mate. And they'll talk about, oh, yeah, but I do believe in the exception to save the mother's life. Okay. All right, let's break that down, shall we? Let's break that down. Let's break that down. So we're saying that we're going to create public policy that says that a doctor, a health care provider, will only kick in to give the care that somebody needs if they're about to die. Think about what we are saying right now. You're saying that good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying that a health care provider will only start providing that care when you're about to die. And so Amber waited 20 hours, 20 hours excruciating hours until finally she was in enough physical distress that her doctors thought they would be okay to treat her. But it was too late. She died of sepsis. And her last words to her mother, which her mother, as you know, tears up and cries every time she speaks it. Last words to her mother, promise me you'll take care of my son. Well, I met last night and I spent time with Amber's mother and her sisters, and they spoke about Amber, a daughter, a sister, a mother, with the deep love that you can imagine and how terribly they miss her. And their pain is heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking. Amber's mother, Shannette told me that the word preventable is over and over again in her head when she learned about how her child died. The word preventable. She cannot, she can't stop thinking about the word that they spoke to her. It was preventable. Because you see, medical experts have now determined that Amber's death was preventable. And through the pain and the grief of her mother, who courageously told her story, I promised her as she has asked that we will make sure Amber is not just remembered as a statistic. That she will not just be remembered as a statistic. So that people will know she was a mother and a daughter and a sister and that she was loved and that she should be alive today. And that she should be alive today. And many of us remember, there's so many leaders here. From two years ago when the DOBS decision came down, we knew this could happen. There is a word preventable and there is another word predictable. And the reality is for every story we hear of the suffering under Trump abortion bans, there are so many other stories we're not hearing. But we're suffering as happening every day in our country. An untold number of people suffering. Women who are also being made to feel as though they did something wrong. The judgment factor here is outrageous. Being made as though to feel as though they are criminals. As though they are alone. So to those women, to those families. I say on behalf of what I believe we all say, we see you and you are not alone. And we are all here standing with you. Standing with you. You are not alone. You are not alone. So, George, and we will not be silent. And we will not be silent. But this is a health care crisis. This is a health care crisis. And Donald Trump is the architect of this crisis. He brags about overturning Roe v. Wade. In his own words, quote, I did it and I'm proud to have done it, he says. He is proud. Proud that women are dying. Proud that doctors and nurses could be thrown in prison for administering care. Proud that young women today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers. How dare he? How dare he? And in our debate last week. Well, that was fun. And I know everyone here paid attention to the words, though. The words, right? I'm trying to get another debate. We'll see. But in our debate last week, remember when he said everyone wanted Roe v. Wade to be overturned? Well, exactly. I don't know where everyone is either. Because women have been arrested and charged for miscarriages. They didn't want that. I was speaking with a physician who is here, who has in her professional experience been administering care to girls. What we know is that 12 and 13-year-old survivors of assault are being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. They didn't want this. And couples just trying to grow their family being cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. They didn't want this. And on that last one, you probably saw this week for the second time, Republicans in the United States Senate blocked a bill that would protect access to IVF treatment. Now, consider among the multitude of ironies the fact that on the one hand, these extremists want to tell women they don't have the freedom to end an unwanted pregnancy. And on the other hand, these extremists are telling women and their partners they don't have the freedom to start a family. Okay. They want to restrict access to contraception as well. And now Donald Trump says that he would personally cast his foe in Florida, which is where he now lives, to support their extreme abortion ban, just like the one that is here in Georgia. Well, let's say, foe. And... Well, that's a whole different policy discussion that we'll have for another day. But let's understand if he is elected again as president, Donald Trump will go further. We know what we're up against and we must speak of the stakes. We must remind everybody here knows, but we got to remind our friends, our neighbors, our coworkers, the stakes are so high. Because if he is elected again, I am certain he will sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every single state, and he would create a national anti-abortion coordinator. Look at Project 2025. And force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. It's right there. I can't believe they put that Project 2025 in writing. They literally put it in writing. They bound it. They handed it out. I mean, they are simply out of their minds. And it's clear that they just don't trust women. Well, we trust women. We trust women. And like Dr. Reddick said, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms as president of the United States, I was so proudly signed an interlaw. So 46 days to go. And let us remember that momentum on this and so many issues, momentum is on our side. Let's remember, since Roe was overturned, every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, from Kansas to California to Kentucky, in Michigan, Montana, Vermont, and Ohio, the people of America have voted for freedom. The people of America have voted for freedom. And not just by a little, but by overwhelming margins, from so-called red states to so-called blue states, providing and making clear also this is not a partisan issue. This is not a partisan issue. And it is proving that the voice of the people has been heard and will be heard again. And will be heard again. So 46 days to go in probably the most consequential election of our lifetimes. And with that then, today I ask Georgia, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we trust women? Do we believe in reproductive freedom? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you. Good.",full,2585

She cannot, she can't stop thinking about the word that they spoke to her. It was preventable. Because you see, medical experts have now determined that Amber's death was preventable. And through the pain and the grief of her mother, who courageously told her story, I promised her as she has asked that we will make sure Amber is not just remembered as a statistic. That she will not just be remembered as a statistic. So that people will know she was a mother and a daughter and a sister and that she was loved and that she should be alive today. And that she should be alive today. And many of us remember, there's so many leaders here. From two years ago when the DOBS decision came down, we knew this could happen. There is a word preventable and there is another word predictable. And the reality is for every story we hear of the suffering under Trump abortion bans, there are so many other stories we're not hearing. But we're suffering as happening every day in our country. An untold number of people suffering. Women who are also being made to feel as though they did something wrong. The judgment factor here is outrageous. Being made as though to feel as though they are criminals. As though they are alone. So to those women, to those families. I say on behalf of what I believe we all say, we see you and you are not alone. And we are all here standing with you. Standing with you. You are not alone. You are not alone. So, George, and we will not be silent. And we will not be silent. But this is a health care crisis. This is a health care crisis. And Donald Trump is the architect of this crisis. He brags about overturning Roe v. Wade. In his own words, quote, I did it and I'm proud to have done it, he says. He is proud. Proud that women are dying. Proud that doctors and nurses could be thrown in prison for administering care.",chunk_5,383
2024-09-20,Rally,"Harris Campaign Rally in Atlanta, Georgia",chunk,"Proud that young women today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers. How dare he? How dare he? And in our debate last week. Well, that was fun. And I know everyone here paid attention to the words, though. The words, right? I'm trying to get another debate. We'll see. But in our debate last week, remember when he said everyone wanted Roe v. Wade to be overturned? Well, exactly. I don't know where everyone is either. Because women have been arrested and charged for miscarriages. They didn't want that. I was speaking with a physician who is here, who has in her professional experience been administering care to girls. What we know is that 12 and 13-year-old survivors of assault are being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. They didn't want this. And couples just trying to grow their family being cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. They didn't want this. And on that last one, you probably saw this week for the second time, Republicans in the United States Senate blocked a bill that would protect access to IVF treatment. Now, consider among the multitude of ironies the fact that on the one hand, these extremists want to tell women they don't have the freedom to end an unwanted pregnancy. And on the other hand, these extremists are telling women and their partners they don't have the freedom to start a family. Okay. They want to restrict access to contraception as well. And now Donald Trump says that he would personally cast his foe in Florida, which is where he now lives, to support their extreme abortion ban, just like the one that is here in Georgia. Well, let's say, foe. And.. Well, that's a whole different policy discussion that we'll have for another day. But let's understand if he is elected again as president, Donald Trump will go further. We know what we're up against and we must speak of the stakes. We must remind everybody here knows, but we got to remind our friends, our neighbors, our coworkers, the stakes are so high. Because if he is elected again, I am certain he will sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every single state, and he would create a national anti-abortion coordinator.",chunk_6,383
2024-09-20,Rally,"Harris Campaign Rally in Atlanta, Georgia",chunk,"Look at Project 2025. And force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. It's right there. I can't believe they put that Project 2025 in writing. They literally put it in writing. They bound it. They handed it out. I mean, they are simply out of their minds. And it's clear that they just don't trust women. Well, we trust women. We trust women. And like Dr. Reddick said, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms as president of the United States, I was so proudly signed an interlaw. So 46 days to go. And let us remember that momentum on this and so many issues, momentum is on our side. Let's remember, since Roe was overturned, every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, from Kansas to California to Kentucky, in Michigan, Montana, Vermont, and Ohio, the people of America have voted for freedom. The people of America have voted for freedom. And not just by a little, but by overwhelming margins, from so-called red states to so-called blue states, providing and making clear also this is not a partisan issue. This is not a partisan issue. And it is proving that the voice of the people has been heard and will be heard again. And will be heard again. So 46 days to go in probably the most consequential election of our lifetimes. And with that then, today I ask Georgia, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we trust women? Do we believe in reproductive freedom? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you. Good.",chunk_7,281
2024-09-25,Event,"Harris addressed the Economic Club of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",full,"Good afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. Well, it's good to be back in Pittsburgh. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Please have a seat. Please have a seat. Andrea, thank you so very much for that beautiful introduction and for your leadership. It really is my honor to be with you today. Thank you. And thank you to Risa and the Economic Club of Pittsburgh for hosting us today. And I also want to thank Mayor Ganey for being here. Mayor, you greet me each time I come to Pittsburgh. I thank you so very much for that and your leadership. Thank you. So, hello friends. Let's get started. So, we gather at a moment of great consequence. In this election, I believe we have an extraordinary opportunity to make our middle class the engine of America's prosperity. To build a stronger economy where everyone, everywhere, has a chance to pursue their dreams and aspirations. And to ensure that the United States of America continues to out-innovate and out-compete the world. Over the past three and a half years, we have taken major steps forward to recover from the public health and economic crisis we inherited. Inflation has dropped faster here than the rest of the developed world. Unemployment is near record, low levels. We have created almost 740,000 manufacturing jobs, including 650 at the Battery Manufacturing Plant over in Turtle Creek. And we have supported another 15,000 jobs at Montgomery Locks. So, these are local great examples of the work that we have achieved thus far. And last week, for the first time, of course, in four and a half years, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, which will make it just a little easier for families to buy a home or a car or just pay down their credit card bill. But let's be clear. For all these positive steps, the cost of living in America is still just too high. I know it and I know it. And that was true long before the pandemic hit. Many Americans who aspire to own a home are unable to save enough for a down payment on a house. And starting to think that maybe home ownership is just outside of their reach. And folks who live in factory towns and in rural communities who have lost jobs are wondering if those jobs will ever come back. Many Americans are worried about how they'll afford the prescription medication they depend on. And this is happening at a time when many of the biggest corporations continue to make record profits while wages have not kept up pace. I understand the pressures of making ends meet. I grew up in a middle class family. And while we were more fortunate than many, I still remember my mother sitting at that yellow Formica table late at night, cup of tea in hand with a pile of bills in front of her, just trying to make sure that you paid them off by the end of the month. Like so many Americans just trying to make it all work. Every day, millions of Americans are sitting around their own kitchen tables and facing their own financial pressures. Because over the past several decades, our economy has grown better and better for those at the very top and increasingly difficult for those trying to attain, build and hold on to a middle class life. In many ways, this is what this election is all about. The American people face a choice between two fundamentally very different paths for our economy. I intend to chart a new way forward and grow America's middle class. Donald Trump intends to take America backward to the failed policies of the past. He has no intention to grow our middle class. He's only interested in making life better for himself and people like himself. The wealthiest of Americans. You can see it spelled out in his economic agenda. An agenda that gives trillions of dollars in tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations while raising taxes on the middle class by almost $4,000 a year. Slashing over time pay. Throwing tens of millions of Americans off of healthcare. And cutting Social Security and Medicare. In some, his agenda would weaken the economy and hurt working people and the middle class. You see, for Donald Trump, our economy works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers. Not those who actually build them. Not those who wire them. Not those who mop the floors. Well, I have a very different vision. I have a very different vision for our economy. I believe we need to grow our middle class and make sure our economy works for everyone. For people like the people in the neighborhood where I grew up and the hardworking Americans I meet every day across our nation. So I call my vision the opportunity economy. And it's about making sure everyone can find a job and more and more. Because frankly, having a job I believe in our ambition and aspiration should be baseline. And we should aspire and have the ambition and plan to do more. I want Americans and families to be able to not just get by, but be able to get ahead. To thrive. Be able to thrive. I don't want you to have to worry about making your monthly rent if your car breaks down. I want you to be able to save up for your child's education. To take a nice vacation from time to time. I want you to be able to buy Christmas presents for your loved ones without feeling anxious when you're looking at your bank statement. I want you to be able to build some wealth. Not just for yourself, but also for your children and your grandchildren. Intergenerational wealth. And here's the thing. Here's the thing. Here's the beauty of it all. We know how to build an economy like that. We do know how to unlock strong shared economic growth for the American people. History has shown it. Time and again. When we invest in those things that strengthen the middle class, manufacturing, housing, healthcare, education, small businesses, and our communities, we grow our economy and catalyze the entire country to succeed. I have pledged that building a strong middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. And the reason... But let me tell you, the reason is not about politics and it's not about ideology. From my perspective, it's just common sense. It's just common sense. It's actually what works. When the middle class is strong, America is strong. And we can build a stronger middle class. The American economy. We know this here. The American economy is the most powerful force for innovation and wealth creation in human history. We just need to move past the failed policies that we have proven don't work. And like generations before us, let us be inspired by what is possible. As president, I will be grounded in my fundamental values of fairness, dignity, and opportunity. And I promise you I will be pragmatic in my approach. I will engage in what Franklin Roosevelt called bold, persistent experimentation. Because I believe we shouldn't be constrained by ideology and instead should seek practical solutions to problems. Realistic assessments of what is working and what is not. Applying metrics to our analysis. Applying facts to our analysis. And stay focused then, not only on the crises at hand, but on our big goals. On what's best for America over the long term. And part of being pragmatic means taking good ideas from wherever they come. Listen, you all know my career, Andrea shared it with you. I am a devout public servant. I also know the limitations of government. I've always been and will always be, and be clear about this, I've always been and will always be a strong supporter of workers and unions. And I also believe we need to engage those who create most of the jobs in America. Look, I'm a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets. I believe in consistent and transparent rules of the road to create a stable business environment. And I know the power of American innovation. I've been working with entrepreneurs and business owners my whole career. And I believe companies need to play by the rules. Respect the rights of workers and unions. And abide by fair competition. And if they don't, I will hold them accountable. And if anyone has a question about that, just look at my record as Attorney General. I've hit my record in California taking on the big banks for predatory lending, taking on big healthcare companies for conspiring to jack up prices, taking on a big for profit college for scamming veterans and students. At the same time, I believe that most companies are working hard to do the right thing by their customers and the employees who depend on them. And we must work with them to grow our economy. I believe an active partnership between government and the private sector is one of the most effective ways to fully unlock economic opportunity. And that is what I will do when I am president. I will target the major barriers to opportunity and remove them. We will identify common sense solutions to help Americans buy a home, start a business and build wealth. And we will adopt them. So let's start then with the first pillar of an opportunity economy, which is lowering costs. So I made that our top priority for obvious reasons. Because if we want the middle class to be the growth engine of our economy, we need to restore basic economic security for middle class families. To that end, the most practical thing we can do right now is to cut taxes for middle class families and individuals. And that's what we will do. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a middle class tax break that includes $6,000 for new parents during the first year of their child's life. To help families cover everything from car seats to cribs. We'll also cut the cost of childcare and elder care. And finally, give all working people access to paid leave, which will help everyone caring for children, caring for aging parents, and that sandwich generation, which is caring for both. So I have a personal experience with caregiving. I remember being there for my mother when she was diagnosed with cancer. Cooking meals for her, taking her to her appointments, just trying to make her comfortable, figuring out which clothes were soft enough that they wouldn't irritate her. And telling her stories to try and make her laugh. I know caregiving is about dignity. It really is. And when we lower the cost and ease the burdens people face, we will not only make it then easier for them to meet their obligations as caregivers, we will also make it more possible for them to go to work and pursue their economic aspirations. And when that happens, our economy as a whole grows stronger. Now, middle class tax cuts are just the start of my plan. We will also go after the biggest drivers of cost for the middle class and work to bring them down. And one of those, some would argue, one of the biggest is the cost of housing. So here's what we will do. We will cut the red tape that stops homes from being built and take on, in addition, corporate landlords who are hiking rental prices. And we will work with builders and developers to construct 3 million new homes and rentals for the middle class because increasing the housing supply will help drive down the cost of housing. We will also help first time home buyers just get their foot in the door with the $25,000 down payment assistance. Because the goal is clear, let's help more Americans afford to buy a home which we know is a critical step in their ability to grow their wealth and intergenerational wealth. And we will work to reduce other big costs for middle class families. We will take on bad actors who exploit emergencies and drive up grocery prices by enacting the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging. I had the experience of dealing with that when I was Attorney General. We will take on big pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans just like we did for our seniors. Now by contrast, Donald Trump has no intention of lowering costs for the middle class. In fact, his economic agenda would actually raise prices. And listen, that's not just my opinion. A survey of top economists by the Financial Times and the University of Chicago found that by an overwhelming 70 to 3% margin, my plan would be better for keeping inflation low. Objective economists have been very clear. The second pillar of an opportunity economy is investing in American innovation and entrepreneurship. So for the last century, the United States of America has been a beacon around the world. And as your Vice President now for almost four years, I've been traveling the world, meeting with world leaders, meeting with foreign leaders, meeting with business people in various countries with which we have partnership. And I will tell you, America remains a beacon for what it means to inspire and invest in innovation. Not only for our ability to come up with some of the most breakthrough ideas, but also our ability to turn those ideas into some of the most consequential innovations the world has ever known. I believe the source of our success is the ingenuity, the dynamism and enterprising spirit of the American people. To paraphrase, yes, it is, it's our nature, it's our nature. To paraphrase Warren Buffett, since the founding of our nation, there has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America. And we need to guard that spirit. We have to guard that spirit. Let it always inspire us. Let it always be the source of our optimism, which is that spirit that is so uniquely American. And let that then inspire us by helping us to be inspired to solve the problems that so many face, including our small business owners. So, as I travel the country, what I hear time and again from those who own small businesses and those who aspire to start them is that too often an entrepreneur has a great idea, not too often, that's good. And they have the willingness to take the risk, but they don't have access to the capital that they need to make it real. And as Andrea said, not everybody was handed on a silver platter for $100 million and then filed bankruptcy six times. Oh, I said that. I actually said that. Well, we can make it easier. We can make it easier for our small businesses to access capital. On average, it costs about $40,000 to start a new business. But currently the tax deduction for startups is only $5,000. So currently for startup costs, the tax deduction is $5,000. Well, in 2024, it is almost impossible to start a business on $5,000. Which is why as president, I will make the startup deduction 10 times richer and we will raise it from $5,000 to $50,000. Tax deduction. And provide low and no interest loans to small businesses that want to expand. All of which will help achieve our ambitious, some would say, but that's okay. Let's be ambitious. Our ambitious goal of 25 million new small business applications by the end of my first term. I know this is very achievable. And for anyone here who is a small business owner, works for a small business or has a small business in your life, you understand what I'm talking about in terms of when we build up our small businesses, what that does to entire communities to lift them up economically, civically, culturally, and in every way. Small businesses, the point being, help drive our economy. And they create, they create nearly 50% of private sector jobs. And they strengthen our middle class. And if we can harness the entrepreneurialism of the American people and unlock the full potential of aspiring founders and small business owners, I am optimistic that no one will be able to outpace us. By contrast, Donald Trump, when he was president, has been described by one of the nation's leading experts on small businesses in a piece he published in a major paper as not being good for small businesses. In fact, the title, the title, wait, because I'm bearing the lead right now. One of the leading experts on small businesses published a piece in one of the major newspapers, and the title, I'm going to quote, does Donald Trump hate small businesses? And their answer was yes. Their answer was yes. Because at the same time that Donald Trump was giving a tax cut to big corporations and billionaires, he tried to slash programs for small businesses and raise borrowing costs for them. Instead of making it easier, he actually made it more difficult for them to access capital. And that's not surprising because Donald Trump just does not prioritize small businesses. He does not seem to value, frankly, the essential role they play. But look, when I look at small business owners, I see some of the heroes of our economy, not only entrepreneurs, but as I said, civic leaders, community leaders, part of the glue that holds communities together. The third pillar of our opportunity economy is leading the world in the industries of the future. And making sure America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century. One of the recurring themes in American history is that when we make an intentional effort to invest in our industrial strength, it leads to extraordinary prosperity and security. Not only for years, but for generations. Think of Alexander Hamilton having the foresight to build the manufacturing capabilities of our new nation. Think of Lincoln and the transcontinental railroad. Think of Eisenhower and the interstate highway system. Kennedy committing America to win the space race and spurring innovation across our society. From our earliest days, America's economic strength has been tied to our industrial strength. And the same is true today. So I will recommit the nation to global leadership in the sectors that will define the next century. We will invest in bio-manufacturing and aerospace. Remain dominant in AI and quantum computing, blockchain and other emerging technologies. Expand our lead in clean energy innovation and manufacturing. So the next generation of breakthroughs from advanced batteries to geothermal to advanced nuclear are not just invented, but built here in America by American workers. And we will invest in the industries that, for example, made Pittsburgh the steel city by offering tax credits for expanding good union jobs in steel and iron and manufacturing communities like here in Mon Valley. And across all these industries of the future, we will prioritize investments for strengthening factory towns. This is so important. For strengthening factory towns, retooling existing factories, hiring locally and working with unions, because no one who grows up in America's greatest industrial or agricultural centers should be abandoned. And understand what that means for real people, people we know, people we care about. We don't have to abandon a strength we've known to achieve a strength that we plan. And here's what else we will do when I'm president. We will double the number of registered apprenticeships by the end of my first term. Because I almost made it a goal of mine. I think I am going to fall short, but trying to visit every IBW local in America, because I'm going to tell you those apprenticeship programs, those are tough duty, man, and women and everyone. They're tough duty. I mean, it's talk about the skills that are about engineering and science and math and just the most highly skilled folks who are in those apprenticeships and teaching there. And so one of the things we must do understanding that and understanding the nature of that part of our educational system is let's eliminate degree requirements while increasing skills development. And let's start with something I can do as president was ensure that we do that for the half million of federal jobs within our ability to make it so. Showing what is possible and then challenging the private sector to make a similar commitment to emphasizing skills and not just degrees. And we will reform our tax laws to make it easier for businesses to let workers share in their company success. And I will challenge the private sector to do more to lift up workers through equity profits and benefits so more people can share in America's success and prosperity. And finally, must we build the industries of the future in America. We must also build them faster. You know, there's a time for patients and there's a time for impatience. That's not an ecclesiastics, but... Just want to script for a minute, Mayor. And the simple truth is in America it takes too long and it costs too much to build. Whether it's a new housing development, a new factory or a new bridge, projects take too long to go from concept to reality. It happens in blue states, it happens in red states. And it's a national problem. I will tell you this, China is not moving slowly. They're not. And we can't afford to either. If we are to compete, we can't afford to either. As president, if things are not moving quickly, I will demand to know why and I will act. I will work with Congress, workers and businesses, cities and states, community groups and local leaders to reform, permitting, to cut red tape and get things moving faster. Because, look, as I said, patients may be of virtue, but not when it comes to job creation or America's competitiveness. Many of you know the Empire State Building. You know how long it took to build that? One year. The Pentagon, you know how long that took? 16 months. No one can tell me. We can't build quickly in our country. I've got empirical evidence. Now look, my opponent Donald Trump, well, he makes big promises on manufacturing. Just yesterday he went out and promised to bring back manufacturing jobs. And if that sounds familiar, it should. In 2016, he went out and made that very same promise about the carrier plant in Indianapolis. You'll remember, carrier then off-shored hundreds of jobs to Mexico under his watch. And it wasn't just there. On Trump's watch, off-shoring went up and manufacturing jobs went down across our country. And across our economy, all told, almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during his presidency, starting before the pandemic hit. Making Trump one of the biggest losers ever on manufacturing. Donald Trump also talked a big game on our trade deficit with China. But it is far lower under our watch than any year of his administration, while he constantly got played by China. I will never hesitate to take swift and strong measures when China undermines the rules of the road at the expense of our workers, our communities, and our companies, whether it's flooding the market with steel, inferior, or at all, unfairly subsidizing shipbuilding, or hurting our small businesses with counterfeits. Recall, Donald Trump actually shipped advanced semiconductor chips to China, which helps them upgrade their military. Understand the impact of these so-called policies that really are not about a plan for strengthening our prosperity or our security. I will never sell out America to our competitors or adversaries. Never. Never. And I will always make sure we have the strongest economy and the most lethal fighting force anywhere in the world. So at this pivotal moment, we have an extraordinary opportunity to chart a new way forward, one that positions the United States of America and all of us who are blessed to call this home for success and prosperity in the 21st century. You know, there's an old saying that the best way to predict the future is to invent it. Well, that is the story of the Steel City. That is the story of the Steel City. The city that helped build the middle class, birth America's labor movement, empower the rise of American manufacturing, and the city where Alan Newell and Herbert Simon launched the first AI research hub at Carnegie Mellon. And created entirely new fields like machine learning, and Carnegie Mellon is now home to the largest university robotics center in America. So the proud heritage of Pittsburgh, I so strongly believe, reveals the character of our nation. A nation that harnesses the ambitions, the dreams, and the aspirations of our people, seizes the opportunities before us because we see them, because we believe in them, and then invents the future. That is what we have always done, and that is what we must now do. And I know we will. I thank you all for inviting me. May God bless you. May God bless the United States of America.",full,4239

Not just for yourself, but also for your children and your grandchildren. Intergenerational wealth. And here's the thing. Here's the thing. Here's the beauty of it all. We know how to build an economy like that. We do know how to unlock strong shared economic growth for the American people. History has shown it. Time and again. When we invest in those things that strengthen the middle class, manufacturing, housing, healthcare, education, small businesses, and our communities, we grow our economy and catalyze the entire country to succeed. I have pledged that building a strong middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. And the reason.. But let me tell you, the reason is not about politics and it's not about ideology. From my perspective, it's just common sense. It's just common sense. It's actually what works. When the middle class is strong, America is strong. And we can build a stronger middle class.",chunk_3,378
2024-09-25,Event,"Harris addressed the Economic Club of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",chunk,"The American economy. We know this here. The American economy is the most powerful force for innovation and wealth creation in human history. We just need to move past the failed policies that we have proven don't work. And like generations before us, let us be inspired by what is possible. As president, I will be grounded in my fundamental values of fairness, dignity, and opportunity. And I promise you I will be pragmatic in my approach. I will engage in what Franklin Roosevelt called bold, persistent experimentation. Because I believe we shouldn't be constrained by ideology and instead should seek practical solutions to problems. Realistic assessments of what is working and what is not. Applying metrics to our analysis. Applying facts to our analysis. And stay focused then, not only on the crises at hand, but on our big goals. On what's best for America over the long term. And part of being pragmatic means taking good ideas from wherever they come. Listen, you all know my career, Andrea shared it with you. I am a devout public servant. I also know the limitations of government. I've always been and will always be, and be clear about this, I've always been and will always be a strong supporter of workers and unions. And I also believe we need to engage those who create most of the jobs in America. Look, I'm a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets. I believe in consistent and transparent rules of the road to create a stable business environment. And I know the power of American innovation. I've been working with entrepreneurs and business owners my whole career. And I believe companies need to play by the rules. Respect the rights of workers and unions. And abide by fair competition. And if they don't, I will hold them accountable. And if anyone has a question about that, just look at my record as Attorney General. I've hit my record in California taking on the big banks for predatory lending, taking on big healthcare companies for conspiring to jack up prices, taking on a big for profit college for scamming veterans and students.",chunk_4,360
2024-09-25,Event,"Harris addressed the Economic Club of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",chunk,"At the same time, I believe that most companies are working hard to do the right thing by their customers and the employees who depend on them. And we must work with them to grow our economy. I believe an active partnership between government and the private sector is one of the most effective ways to fully unlock economic opportunity. And that is what I will do when I am president. I will target the major barriers to opportunity and remove them. We will identify common sense solutions to help Americans buy a home, start a business and build wealth. And we will adopt them. So let's start then with the first pillar of an opportunity economy, which is lowering costs. So I made that our top priority for obvious reasons. Because if we want the middle class to be the growth engine of our economy, we need to restore basic economic security for middle class families. To that end, the most practical thing we can do right now is to cut taxes for middle class families and individuals. And that's what we will do. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a middle class tax break that includes $6,000 for new parents during the first year of their child's life. To help families cover everything from car seats to cribs. We'll also cut the cost of childcare and elder care. And finally, give all working people access to paid leave, which will help everyone caring for children, caring for aging parents, and that sandwich generation, which is caring for both. So I have a personal experience with caregiving. I remember being there for my mother when she was diagnosed with cancer. Cooking meals for her, taking her to her appointments, just trying to make her comfortable, figuring out which clothes were soft enough that they wouldn't irritate her. And telling her stories to try and make her laugh. I know caregiving is about dignity. It really is. And when we lower the cost and ease the burdens people face, we will not only make it then easier for them to meet their obligations as caregivers, we will also make it more possible for them to go to work and pursue their economic aspirations.",chunk_5,377
2024-09-25,Event,"Harris addressed the Economic Club of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",chunk,"And when that happens, our economy as a whole grows stronger. Now, middle class tax cuts are just the start of my plan. We will also go after the biggest drivers of cost for the middle class and work to bring them down. And one of those, some would argue, one of the biggest is the cost of housing. So here's what we will do. We will cut the red tape that stops homes from being built and take on, in addition, corporate landlords who are hiking rental prices. And we will work with builders and developers to construct 3 million new homes and rentals for the middle class because increasing the housing supply will help drive down the cost of housing. We will also help first time home buyers just get their foot in the door with the $25,000 down payment assistance. Because the goal is clear, let's help more Americans afford to buy a home which we know is a critical step in their ability to grow their wealth and intergenerational wealth. And we will work to reduce other big costs for middle class families. We will take on bad actors who exploit emergencies and drive up grocery prices by enacting the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging. I had the experience of dealing with that when I was Attorney General. We will take on big pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans just like we did for our seniors. Now by contrast, Donald Trump has no intention of lowering costs for the middle class. In fact, his economic agenda would actually raise prices. And listen, that's not just my opinion. A survey of top economists by the Financial Times and the University of Chicago found that by an overwhelming 70 to 3% margin, my plan would be better for keeping inflation low. Objective economists have been very clear. The second pillar of an opportunity economy is investing in American innovation and entrepreneurship. So for the last century, the United States of America has been a beacon around the world. And as your Vice President now for almost four years, I've been traveling the world, meeting with world leaders, meeting with foreign leaders, meeting with business people in various countries with which we have partnership.",chunk_6,383
2024-09-25,Event,"Harris addressed the Economic Club of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",chunk,"And I will tell you, America remains a beacon for what it means to inspire and invest in innovation. Not only for our ability to come up with some of the most breakthrough ideas, but also our ability to turn those ideas into some of the most consequential innovations the world has ever known. I believe the source of our success is the ingenuity, the dynamism and enterprising spirit of the American people. To paraphrase, yes, it is, it's our nature, it's our nature. To paraphrase Warren Buffett, since the founding of our nation, there has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America. And we need to guard that spirit. We have to guard that spirit. Let it always inspire us. Let it always be the source of our optimism, which is that spirit that is so uniquely American. And let that then inspire us by helping us to be inspired to solve the problems that so many face, including our small business owners. So, as I travel the country, what I hear time and again from those who own small businesses and those who aspire to start them is that too often an entrepreneur has a great idea, not too often, that's good. And they have the willingness to take the risk, but they don't have access to the capital that they need to make it real. And as Andrea said, not everybody was handed on a silver platter for $100 million and then filed bankruptcy six times. Oh, I said that. I actually said that. Well, we can make it easier. We can make it easier for our small businesses to access capital. On average, it costs about $40,000 to start a new business. But currently the tax deduction for startups is only $5,000. So currently for startup costs, the tax deduction is $5,000. Well, in 2024, it is almost impossible to start a business on $5,000. Which is why as president, I will make the startup deduction 10 times richer and we will raise it from $5,000 to $50,000. Tax deduction. And provide low and no interest loans to small businesses that want to expand. All of which will help achieve our ambitious, some would say, but that's okay.",chunk_7,374

Our ambitious goal of 25 million new small business applications by the end of my first term. I know this is very achievable. And for anyone here who is a small business owner, works for a small business or has a small business in your life, you understand what I'm talking about in terms of when we build up our small businesses, what that does to entire communities to lift them up economically, civically, culturally, and in every way. Small businesses, the point being, help drive our economy. And they create, they create nearly 50% of private sector jobs. And they strengthen our middle class. And if we can harness the entrepreneurialism of the American people and unlock the full potential of aspiring founders and small business owners, I am optimistic that no one will be able to outpace us. By contrast, Donald Trump, when he was president, has been described by one of the nation's leading experts on small businesses in a piece he published in a major paper as not being good for small businesses. In fact, the title, the title, wait, because I'm bearing the lead right now. One of the leading experts on small businesses published a piece in one of the major newspapers, and the title, I'm going to quote, does Donald Trump hate small businesses? And their answer was yes. Their answer was yes. Because at the same time that Donald Trump was giving a tax cut to big corporations and billionaires, he tried to slash programs for small businesses and raise borrowing costs for them. Instead of making it easier, he actually made it more difficult for them to access capital. And that's not surprising because Donald Trump just does not prioritize small businesses. He does not seem to value, frankly, the essential role they play. But look, when I look at small business owners, I see some of the heroes of our economy, not only entrepreneurs, but as I said, civic leaders, community leaders, part of the glue that holds communities together.

One of the recurring themes in American history is that when we make an intentional effort to invest in our industrial strength, it leads to extraordinary prosperity and security. Not only for years, but for generations. Think of Alexander Hamilton having the foresight to build the manufacturing capabilities of our new nation. Think of Lincoln and the transcontinental railroad. Think of Eisenhower and the interstate highway system. Kennedy committing America to win the space race and spurring innovation across our society. From our earliest days, America's economic strength has been tied to our industrial strength. And the same is true today. So I will recommit the nation to global leadership in the sectors that will define the next century. We will invest in bio-manufacturing and aerospace. Remain dominant in AI and quantum computing, blockchain and other emerging technologies. Expand our lead in clean energy innovation and manufacturing. So the next generation of breakthroughs from advanced batteries to geothermal to advanced nuclear are not just invented, but built here in America by American workers. And we will invest in the industries that, for example, made Pittsburgh the steel city by offering tax credits for expanding good union jobs in steel and iron and manufacturing communities like here in Mon Valley. And across all these industries of the future, we will prioritize investments for strengthening factory towns. This is so important. For strengthening factory towns, retooling existing factories, hiring locally and working with unions, because no one who grows up in America's greatest industrial or agricultural centers should be abandoned. And understand what that means for real people, people we know, people we care about. We don't have to abandon a strength we've known to achieve a strength that we plan. And here's what else we will do when I'm president. We will double the number of registered apprenticeships by the end of my first term.",chunk_9,327
2024-09-25,Event,"Harris addressed the Economic Club of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",chunk,"Because I almost made it a goal of mine. I think I am going to fall short, but trying to visit every IBW local in America, because I'm going to tell you those apprenticeship programs, those are tough duty, man, and women and everyone. They're tough duty. I mean, it's talk about the skills that are about engineering and science and math and just the most highly skilled folks who are in those apprenticeships and teaching there. And so one of the things we must do understanding that and understanding the nature of that part of our educational system is let's eliminate degree requirements while increasing skills development. And let's start with something I can do as president was ensure that we do that for the half million of federal jobs within our ability to make it so. Showing what is possible and then challenging the private sector to make a similar commitment to emphasizing skills and not just degrees. And we will reform our tax laws to make it easier for businesses to let workers share in their company success. And I will challenge the private sector to do more to lift up workers through equity profits and benefits so more people can share in America's success and prosperity. And finally, must we build the industries of the future in America. We must also build them faster. You know, there's a time for patients and there's a time for impatience. That's not an ecclesiastics, but.. Just want to script for a minute, Mayor. And the simple truth is in America it takes too long and it costs too much to build. Whether it's a new housing development, a new factory or a new bridge, projects take too long to go from concept to reality. It happens in blue states, it happens in red states. And it's a national problem. I will tell you this, China is not moving slowly. They're not. And we can't afford to either. If we are to compete, we can't afford to either. As president, if things are not moving quickly, I will demand to know why and I will act. I will work with Congress, workers and businesses, cities and states, community groups and local leaders to reform, permitting, to cut red tape and get things moving faster.",chunk_10,384

Many of you know the Empire State Building. You know how long it took to build that? One year. The Pentagon, you know how long that took? 16 months. No one can tell me. We can't build quickly in our country. I've got empirical evidence. Now look, my opponent Donald Trump, well, he makes big promises on manufacturing. Just yesterday he went out and promised to bring back manufacturing jobs. And if that sounds familiar, it should. In 2016, he went out and made that very same promise about the carrier plant in Indianapolis. You'll remember, carrier then off-shored hundreds of jobs to Mexico under his watch. And it wasn't just there. On Trump's watch, off-shoring went up and manufacturing jobs went down across our country. And across our economy, all told, almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during his presidency, starting before the pandemic hit. Making Trump one of the biggest losers ever on manufacturing. Donald Trump also talked a big game on our trade deficit with China. But it is far lower under our watch than any year of his administration, while he constantly got played by China. I will never hesitate to take swift and strong measures when China undermines the rules of the road at the expense of our workers, our communities, and our companies, whether it's flooding the market with steel, inferior, or at all, unfairly subsidizing shipbuilding, or hurting our small businesses with counterfeits. Recall, Donald Trump actually shipped advanced semiconductor chips to China, which helps them upgrade their military. Understand the impact of these so-called policies that really are not about a plan for strengthening our prosperity or our security. I will never sell out America to our competitors or adversaries. Never. Never. And I will always make sure we have the strongest economy and the most lethal fighting force anywhere in the world.

I'm a single mom who lost her son after first losing my husband. My son Jacob died in 2020 at only 31 years old. He died from fentanyl poisoning after drugs he was taking turned out to be laced. He had enough fentanyl to kill three healthy people. Jacob was an avid tennis watcher and a dedicated cyclist. It was devastating when he died. It still is. Losing a child isn't something you get over. But I've made sure every single day since to make sure his death meant something. Which is why I'm here today. When I heard what Vice President Harris had to say at the Oprah Town Hall, I knew she was going to be a fighter for me, for Jacob, and for families like ours who have lost our loved ones. Vice President Harris understands what fentanyl has done to families and to kids in this country. That's why she backed the bipartisan border deal, the one Trump tanked. That would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl. And it's why she's here in Douglas, a town that my husband grew up in and where we have so much family. Thank you to all the folks here today for supporting me. I trust Harris to get the job done because she's done it. As Attorney General, she took on these drug cartels at smuggled drugs across the U.S. border. She protected people when it mattered most. She's here today because she cares about us. She cares about our families and she cares about securing the border. Now it's my honor to introduce Vice President Kamala Harris. Good afternoon. Hi, everyone. Hi. Good afternoon. Can we please applaud Theresa and her extraordinary courage? Please can we applaud her? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please have a seat, everyone. Thank you. It's good to be back in Arizona. It is good to be back in Arizona. Thank you all. Thank you so very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you so very much. I just wanted to for a moment speak about Theresa. We had some time together backstage. I think that in moments of crisis, such as the fentanyl crisis, there are people who through their suffering and their pain rise with courage in such a selfless way to be a voice for others with the anticipation and the hope and the hard work of hoping that their story will be the reason other people don't have that story. And you sharing your story about Jacob and your advocacy on why we have to stop this scourge. It's so incredibly important. And again, I applaud Theresa. And I know we all do. And our need to stop this issue is one of the reason that we are all here together today. I also want to thank the extraordinary elected officials who are here. Senator Mark Kelly came with me. He and his extraordinary wife, Gabby Giffords, traveled with me from Washington, D.C. to be here. And Senator Kelly has been talking with me for quite some time about the importance of this visit. And so I thank you in front of all of our friends for your work. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Attorney General Chris Mays, who just tore up the floor. She is, you know, one of, I'm going to talk a bit about it in a minute, but some of the work that I have done in my career as Attorney General and watching her do the work that she has done as Attorney General really does emphasize the importance of having the right leader at the right time, in the right place. And that's who she is. Mayor Hewish. Thank you for the warm welcome. We've spent some time together. You've shared with me the needs of your community. And I thank you for your leadership as well. And to all the elected and community leaders here today, thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. Before I begin, I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. I spoke this morning with our FEMA administrator, Chris Well, and President Biden and I, of course, will continue to monitor the situation closely. We have mobilized more than 1,500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been impacted. We have food, water, and generators that are ready for deployment. And we are working to restore power for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages. And I just want to stress, and for the press that is here, to those who are watching, the storm continues to be dangerous and deadly. And lives have been lost and the risk of flooding still remains high. So I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment. So thank you all. And now I'll speak about, in particular, the people who are here today and why we are gathered here together today. So, Arizona, I think you all know, and this is why you are here, there are consequential issues at stake in this election. And one is the security of our border. The United States is a sovereign nation. And I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them. And I take that responsibility very seriously. We are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story. And so we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane, and that it makes our country stronger. So I've just come from visiting the border in the Port of Entry in Douglas. I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and customs officers who every day see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help keep our nation secure. And they need more resources to do their jobs, which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize and expand the Port of Entry here in Douglas. And why last December I helped raise the rate of overtime pay for border agents, and also why I strongly supported the Comprehensive Border Security Bill. Written last year, written last year as you know by a bipartisan group of senators, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, that bill would have hired 1,500 more border agents and officers. It would have paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally. And it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers. It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol Union. And it should be in effect today, producing results in real time right now for our country. But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said stop the bill. Because you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future. And so even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the border security bill, it is my pledge to you that as President of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law. And let me say, the issue of border security is not a new issue to me. I was Attorney General of a border state for two terms. I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause. And the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs. I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States. I've seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room, complete with lighting and air conditioning, making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs and human beings. And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings. My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels. We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa Cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States. We seized millions of dollars worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cartel. And broke up a drug trafficking operation including pill mills and so called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results. As Attorney General of California, it was ten years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American Attorneys General and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican Attorneys General to address this issue and in particular to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity. All of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers. And I started as Attorney General the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy. So stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me and it is a long standing priority of mine. I have done that work and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected President of the United States. And it is my pledge to you understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace common sense approaches and new technologies to get the job done. Because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. They could care less. They've got one goal in mind. And it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for common sense solutions, understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don't work together to fix these problems. And look, transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always innovating. So to disrupt them, we must do the same and that means again working together in real time, grounded on finding common sense approaches, not just about some rhetoric at a rally, but actually doing the work of fixing a problem. And as President, I won't only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked, I will do more to secure our border. To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from reentering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure. And that is my goal. Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal. So much so that using it one time only can be fatal. I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, a child, to fentanyl. And their grief is heartbreaking. And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. It's impacting communities across our country regardless of where they are geographically, politically, or any other demographic you choose to talk about. It's a scourge in our country and we have to take it seriously. And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. And I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico. Most often they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry like the one I visited today. The fact is border officers don't have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints. This is unacceptable. They need the resources to do their jobs. And as we could have done with that border security bill, I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines. More personnel, more training, and more technology including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles. And we will make sure that our ports of entry including airports and seaports have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it. I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels. Yes. I will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country. My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States. Our administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals and it has started to happen, but they need to do more. And as President, I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals coming from China. And all of this to say, we must tackle this issue from every angle because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people. It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem. And on this issue, writ large, we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive, which includes fixing our broken immigration system. And let me be clear, I reject the false choice, I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly and humane. We can and we must do both. We must do both. And we need clear legal pathways for people seeking to come into our country. And we must make our current system work better. For example, it can take years for asylum claims to be decided. Well, this is a problem we can solve, including by hiring more asylum officers and expanding processing centers in people's home countries. And as president, I will work with Congress to create, at long last, a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years, for years, and deserve to have a system that works. I also have in mind our dreamers. I have met, I have met with so many of our dreamers throughout my career, they who have grown up in the United States, were educated here, pay taxes here, serve in our military, and contribute to our communities every day. They are American in every way. But still, they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And this problem has gone unsolved at this point now for decades. The same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables and who sustain our agricultural industry. And they too have been in legal limbo for years. Because politicians have refused to come together to fix our broken immigration system. Well, as president, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions, solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long. For far too long, we have all known this is not working as it can and as it should. And so as I said at the beginning, these issues are highly consequential for our nation. And the contrast in this election is clear. It is a choice between common sense solutions and the same old political games. In the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges. He did not solve the shortage of border agents. He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system. And did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge. As overdoses went up during his presidency, he fought to slash funding for the fight against fentanyl. And what did he do instead? Well, let's talk about that. He separated families. He ripped toddlers out of their mothers' arms, put children in cages and tried to end protections for dreamers. He made the challenges at the border worse. And he is still, and he is still, fanning the flames of fear and division. And let me be clear, that is not the work of a leader. That is not the work of a leader. And that is, in fact, I think we all believe, an abdication of leadership. And so, on behalf of all across our nation who want to see these problems solved, I say, we cannot accept Donald Trump's failure to lead. We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions. And let's see what's happening. Let's not permit scapegoating instead of solutions or rhetoric instead of results. As your president, I will protect our nation's sovereignty, secure our border, and work to fix our broken system of immigration. And I will partner with Democrats, Republicans, and independents to do it. Arizona, it is time for us to turn the page on the ugly battles that have characterized our politics. And it is time to move forward together to achieve real solutions that make our country stronger. And I know we can get this done. I know we have the will. I know we have the courage. I know the solutions are at hand. And I know we are ready. And so, with all of that, I say thank you, may God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",full,3206
2024-09-27,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Douglas, Arizona",chunk,"Hello, my name is Teresa Guerrero and I'm a native Arizona. I'm also a single mom. I'm a single mom who lost her son after first losing my husband. My son Jacob died in 2020 at only 31 years old. He died from fentanyl poisoning after drugs he was taking turned out to be laced. He had enough fentanyl to kill three healthy people. Jacob was an avid tennis watcher and a dedicated cyclist. It was devastating when he died. It still is. Losing a child isn't something you get over. But I've made sure every single day since to make sure his death meant something. Which is why I'm here today. When I heard what Vice President Harris had to say at the Oprah Town Hall, I knew she was going to be a fighter for me, for Jacob, and for families like ours who have lost our loved ones. Vice President Harris understands what fentanyl has done to families and to kids in this country. That's why she backed the bipartisan border deal, the one Trump tanked. That would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl. And it's why she's here in Douglas, a town that my husband grew up in and where we have so much family. Thank you to all the folks here today for supporting me. I trust Harris to get the job done because she's done it. As Attorney General, she took on these drug cartels at smuggled drugs across the U.S. border. She protected people when it mattered most. She's here today because she cares about us. She cares about our families and she cares about securing the border. Now it's my honor to introduce Vice President Kamala Harris. Good afternoon. Hi, everyone. Hi. Good afternoon. Can we please applaud Theresa and her extraordinary courage? Please can we applaud her? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please have a seat, everyone. Thank you. It's good to be back in Arizona. It is good to be back in Arizona. Thank you all. Thank you so very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you so very much. I just wanted to for a moment speak about Theresa. We had some time together backstage.",chunk_1,387
2024-09-27,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Douglas, Arizona",chunk,"I think that in moments of crisis, such as the fentanyl crisis, there are people who through their suffering and their pain rise with courage in such a selfless way to be a voice for others with the anticipation and the hope and the hard work of hoping that their story will be the reason other people don't have that story. And you sharing your story about Jacob and your advocacy on why we have to stop this scourge. It's so incredibly important. And again, I applaud Theresa. And I know we all do. And our need to stop this issue is one of the reason that we are all here together today. I also want to thank the extraordinary elected officials who are here. Senator Mark Kelly came with me. He and his extraordinary wife, Gabby Giffords, traveled with me from Washington, D.C. to be here. And Senator Kelly has been talking with me for quite some time about the importance of this visit. And so I thank you in front of all of our friends for your work. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Attorney General Chris Mays, who just tore up the floor. She is, you know, one of, I'm going to talk a bit about it in a minute, but some of the work that I have done in my career as Attorney General and watching her do the work that she has done as Attorney General really does emphasize the importance of having the right leader at the right time, in the right place. And that's who she is. Mayor Hewish. Thank you for the warm welcome. We've spent some time together. You've shared with me the needs of your community. And I thank you for your leadership as well. And to all the elected and community leaders here today, thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. Before I begin, I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. I spoke this morning with our FEMA administrator, Chris Well, and President Biden and I, of course, will continue to monitor the situation closely. We have mobilized more than 1,500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been impacted. We have food, water, and generators that are ready for deployment.",chunk_2,386
2024-09-27,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Douglas, Arizona",chunk,"And we are working to restore power for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages. And I just want to stress, and for the press that is here, to those who are watching, the storm continues to be dangerous and deadly. And lives have been lost and the risk of flooding still remains high. So I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment. So thank you all. And now I'll speak about, in particular, the people who are here today and why we are gathered here together today. So, Arizona, I think you all know, and this is why you are here, there are consequential issues at stake in this election. And one is the security of our border. The United States is a sovereign nation. And I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them. And I take that responsibility very seriously. We are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story. And so we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane, and that it makes our country stronger. So I've just come from visiting the border in the Port of Entry in Douglas. I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and customs officers who every day see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help keep our nation secure. And they need more resources to do their jobs, which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize and expand the Port of Entry here in Douglas. And why last December I helped raise the rate of overtime pay for border agents, and also why I strongly supported the Comprehensive Border Security Bill. Written last year, written last year as you know by a bipartisan group of senators, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, that bill would have hired 1,500 more border agents and officers.",chunk_3,389
2024-09-27,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Douglas, Arizona",chunk,"It would have paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally. And it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers. It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol Union. And it should be in effect today, producing results in real time right now for our country. But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said stop the bill. Because you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future. And so even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the border security bill, it is my pledge to you that as President of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law. And let me say, the issue of border security is not a new issue to me. I was Attorney General of a border state for two terms. I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause. And the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs. I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States. I've seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room, complete with lighting and air conditioning, making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs and human beings. And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings. My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels. We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa Cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States. We seized millions of dollars worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cartel.",chunk_4,367
2024-09-27,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Douglas, Arizona",chunk,"And broke up a drug trafficking operation including pill mills and so called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results. As Attorney General of California, it was ten years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American Attorneys General and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican Attorneys General to address this issue and in particular to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity. All of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers. And I started as Attorney General the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy. So stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me and it is a long standing priority of mine. I have done that work and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected President of the United States. And it is my pledge to you understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace common sense approaches and new technologies to get the job done. Because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. They could care less. They've got one goal in mind. And it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for common sense solutions, understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don't work together to fix these problems. And look, transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always innovating. So to disrupt them, we must do the same and that means again working together in real time, grounded on finding common sense approaches, not just about some rhetoric at a rally, but actually doing the work of fixing a problem. And as President, I won't only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked, I will do more to secure our border.",chunk_5,352
2024-09-27,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Douglas, Arizona",chunk,"To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from reentering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure. And that is my goal. Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal. So much so that using it one time only can be fatal. I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, a child, to fentanyl. And their grief is heartbreaking. And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. It's impacting communities across our country regardless of where they are geographically, politically, or any other demographic you choose to talk about. It's a scourge in our country and we have to take it seriously. And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. And I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico. Most often they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry like the one I visited today. The fact is border officers don't have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints. This is unacceptable. They need the resources to do their jobs. And as we could have done with that border security bill, I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines. More personnel, more training, and more technology including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles. And we will make sure that our ports of entry including airports and seaports have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it.",chunk_6,394
2024-09-27,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Douglas, Arizona",chunk,"I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels. Yes. I will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country. My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States. Our administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals and it has started to happen, but they need to do more. And as President, I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals coming from China. And all of this to say, we must tackle this issue from every angle because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people. It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem. And on this issue, writ large, we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive, which includes fixing our broken immigration system. And let me be clear, I reject the false choice, I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly and humane. We can and we must do both. We must do both. And we need clear legal pathways for people seeking to come into our country. And we must make our current system work better. For example, it can take years for asylum claims to be decided. Well, this is a problem we can solve, including by hiring more asylum officers and expanding processing centers in people's home countries. And as president, I will work with Congress to create, at long last, a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years, for years, and deserve to have a system that works.",chunk_7,355
2024-09-27,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Douglas, Arizona",chunk,"I also have in mind our dreamers. I have met, I have met with so many of our dreamers throughout my career, they who have grown up in the United States, were educated here, pay taxes here, serve in our military, and contribute to our communities every day. They are American in every way. But still, they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And this problem has gone unsolved at this point now for decades. The same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables and who sustain our agricultural industry. And they too have been in legal limbo for years. Because politicians have refused to come together to fix our broken immigration system. Well, as president, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions, solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long. For far too long, we have all known this is not working as it can and as it should. And so as I said at the beginning, these issues are highly consequential for our nation. And the contrast in this election is clear. It is a choice between common sense solutions and the same old political games. In the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges. He did not solve the shortage of border agents. He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system. And did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge.

Yeah, you solely show I do it over. Nah, you did it. So we didn't do nothing of them. Excuse me. Our biggest guest, I've been corrected, Miss Madam Vice President. Thank you. It is so good to be with you guys. Thank you for sitting down with us. Thank you for having us in your home. We're excited to be here. Thank you both. Thank you both. I'm so happy to have you here. Thank you. You do me great honor to be here. Thank you. In 2013, a blind date with your now husband, Doug, if you think back to that date and now we're here, did you ever imagine this was going to be the journey? No, I just have a really bossy best friend. It was a blind date, right? It was a blind date. And she called me up because she and her husband met him and got to know him. And then she just decided that this might co-work and said to me, just go out with him once. Don't Google him. Just go out with him. Don't Google him. Just give it a shot. Yeah, right? And it turned out she was right. And I am in a very happy marriage. I'm very thankful to say it. So where'd you guys go? Did you really eat? Or did you just do a salad? Like, did you really let your hair down and have fun? So he came to pick me up. OK. What kind of car? A BMW. Uh-oh, OK. Move it in style. OK, but here's the thing. That was actually really funny in retrospect. I gave him the car and he said, I just need to tell you something. And I'm like, OK, what's this going to be? And he said, I'm a really bad driver. Gave you the heads up, huh? So that's how it started. I guess he was just trying to create low expectations. And we went to what turned out to be his one favorite restaurant where everybody knows who he is, which is obviously very smart. So he was showing you off there. Oh, yeah. So he could walk in and they were like, hey, Doug. I see you, Doug. Uh-huh. All right. Exactly. Bay Area Girl. Yeah. Born in Oakland. You grew up around the TMC Times. Yeah. Going to stay at the Warriors. We hear you a big fan. I am. And there was a rumor that you were in the stands when we were there and we believe ERA. I really, what? Yes, yes. I do remember. I do remember. OK, we want to say our warriors are always good, whichever era. But that was a very special time. I mean, it was electric. You guys remember. It was electric. And everybody, we would take Bart to get there and just and go. And it was just, you know, I mean, this is the thing I love about sports in general. But I'm going to say my warriors, our warriors, is that it really was about bringing like all kinds of people from around the Bay Area. And you know, the Bay Area is a melting pot, right? Yeah. All coming in. And that team, I mean, you guys were the best of the best. Legendary. Legendary. You know, it's funny not to cut you off, as I went back in 2017 with Steph and Katie and those guys. And we won a championship right before I retired. But they all wanted to know about that. We believed in the era and the energy around the city. And when I was there, the media was talking about it. The fans were talking about it. And as amazing as that team was and won all the championships, they had a fascination in what we did. What was it like for you guys? For me, it was big for me because I had had some trouble two years before. So I needed to come into a situation where I needed to change. Yeah. And it was a blessing in disguise for me. You know, I landed with a whole bunch of guys I knew. I landed with a coach that didn't judge me, that let me be me. Yeah. And we were able to make history. So it was a blessing for me. Yeah, I think too. I mean, it was almost a melting pot of guys that my career could have been over before it started. That's where I really first got my chance with Don Nelson. Like he said, he was coming off trouble. One of our other brothers, Baron Davis, was very talented. But injuries, it didn't really know what was going on. So it just kind of felt like the Bay put their arms around us. We were out in the streets hanging out from San Francisco to Oakland to Richmond. Probably every club that opened. Yeah, we were there. Fill more. Give us a fill more. They called us to fill more. Yeah, we're out. We were just embracing the community. But I mean, one thing I'll say about the Bay Area fans is like you said, you always want to say they were good. But there was times where they were terrible, but the support never wavered. You guys were so loyal to the fan. Yes. I just, I mean, first of all, loyalty is a general matter in life. I think is one of the most important. Growing up, my mother used to say, you got to have a code. Got to. Got to stand for something. And you figure out what your code is. But loyalty. And then loyalty to your team, right? I mean, nobody like. This is fancy. Yeah, you know. They got the emblem on it and everything, huh? Yes, I do. Look at this. There's like some presidential water right here. As you were saying, excuse me. You got to be loyal to your team. Like my husband and I have different teams. Is he from the Bay two? Well, he's really from Jersey. But he moved to LA when he was a teenager. So most of his fans are LA teams. And so, depending on who's playing, who and what time of the year it is, it's very like really real. Like talking some serious smack. What's your feelings on all three of the teams out of Oakland now? Oh, it breaks my heart. It breaks my heart. Remember, we used to have all of them. You know, and you just drive by that area, you know, when I go to Oakland, when I go to the Bay Area. It's sad. You know, if you like land at Oakland Airport and just pass Coliseum, it is. It breaks my heart. Yeah. And good, good teams. Yeah. Right? For us, I think as players, when our time, we more worried about the workers and the people that were there. Because that's who made us feel good. That's exactly right. The workers, every day we came in there, we saw those smiles. We got hugs by people. Actually, from Oakland. And to see them lose them jobs to San Francisco, yeah, that really didn't happen. You're so right. It was part of the economic engine of Oakland. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And then the vendors, and it was, you know, and it was local folks, small businesses. Yeah. I'll definitely say, I mean, obviously we understand what that era and that team kind of did. They took the team to a new level, and the business side kicked in. Yeah, it really did. I love where they're at in San Francisco, a beautiful stadium, but there'll never be anything like Oracle. Never. No. And I'm always going to go to the same place. No, and I'm always going to think, you know, I mean, Golden State Warriors is Oakland. That's what you think. That's Oakland. That's what you think. I grew up Italian mom, black dad, and was always very proud of my heritage until an incident I had in high school when I was 17, protecting my little sister. Someone called her some names. I did what the big brother did. I ended up getting in trouble in the KKK, came to vandalize, nearly burned down my high school. And I knew at that point, although I was very proud to be Italian and black, that the world looked at me as a black man. You've always been secure in your identity, who you are. But what do you feel or what do you think when you hear people kind of questioning just the fabric of who you are? Well, one, I don't listen to it. I'm really clear about who I am. And if anybody else is not, they need to go through their own level of therapy. That's not my issue. My mother was very clear. She was raising two black girls to be two proud black women. And that was never, it was never a question. You know, it's funny, because over the years, journalists, some, not most, will want to talk about it. And I say, OK, if you want to have this conversation, I'm prepared to have it. But sit down and get comfortable for a few hours. If you want to start talking about race in America, you want to talk about the 1A rule. A drop. You want, right. You want to talk about what it means in terms of who you are perceived to be and the impact that can have on the rest of your life, regardless of who you actually are in terms of your God-given capacity and the rights that you have and should have. So, you know, I don't mess with that. I think that's other people trying to figure some stuff out that they need. They got some issues. They got to deal with it. You've also been attacked for not having biological children, but you are a stepmom and I'm a stepfather. I just had my seventh, that little boy two weeks ago, but I have three stepchildren that are mine. And being a dad was natural. Being a dad to my four sons was natural. But learning to navigate, not wanting to step on toes, how do you earn the love and the trust, how did you earn Ella and Cole's love and trust, and how did you get the name Mamala? I'll start with this. I am a daughter of divorced parents. My parents were divorced when I was five. And just being very frank and handed with you, when Doug and I started dating, you know, his parents have been married over 60 years. I had to explain to him what it is like to be a child of divorced parents. And including that it was really important to me that I knew what he and my relationship would be before I formed a relationship with the kids. Because that's just, from my perspective, an experience not fair to the children. Because, you know, children form attachments. So I was very intentional about waiting until I knew that, okay, this is a real relationship before I got to know the kids. And then we became, I mean, thick as thieves. And I love those children. They are my children. And, you know, we talk about, we have a modern family. And maybe the blessing that I have that not everyone has, although I think everyone should try and work on it, is I have a very close, because it is a very respectful relationship with their mother. It's important. You know, and so- That ain't easy. That's rare. No, but it's not. But it's not. It is not. And you have to work at it. You're giving me a hot flash, hold on. But you have to work at it. You'll be all right. Because here's the thing. Here's the thing that we have to remember. And I know we do. And we feel, but we have to be intentional about it. Because the forces and the emotions will drag us from this point. The most important thing is that our kids grow up healthy. And, you know, I think of the many things that we role model. Probably the thing we role model the most that we don't realize is how to form healthy relationships. You know, we teach our kids how to drive. We will sit down and do homework with them. But one of the things, we are teaching them every day. And we have to be intentional. By just seeing it. We will not be perfect. We will fall short. But it's how to develop healthy, emotional relationships. One of the ways, especially in that dynamic when you're talking about my husband's ex-wife, is how to be respectful. And I was very intentional about, for example, knowing that the kids, as they got to know and form a relationship with me, would not want to feel like they were somehow being disloyal to their mother. And I knew that. And so I was very intentional about always making sure that I was clear with them that I would say things like, well, how does your mom do it? And I love to cook. How does your mom show me how you do it? And I think that's really important. Because this is the thing that I think has become clear, especially as I'm now running for president. And these kind of conversations are becoming more prevalent. Like, what does it mean to be a step here? The people who don't get it are understanding, is there a whole lot more of these kinds of relationships than people realize? This is not the 1950s. Blended is the new norm. Blended families are the new norm. It is. It is. And they're beautiful. And it's a beautiful way to live. To build and grow your family. You know, I talk about it even in my speech at the convention. I have, and I grew up with, the family that is my family by blood and the family that is my family by love. And sometimes that's thicker. And that's exactly right. That's thicker. That's exactly right. I think increasingly people, especially younger people, understand that, right? That there's the family you're born into, and then there's the family you choose. And it's on you to make a decision about what you want and how you define your family. And you have the right to do that. I tell Mike, I'm just an extra layer of support and protection. I'm not there to replace your dad. I'm not there to, you know, I'm here to help in any way possible. And so Mamala came about because that, because it's Kamala. And then I just got created with it. And it's Mamala. I love it. All right, shifting a little bit to policy talk. And before we talk about policy, can you briefly explain, because I think sometimes there's misconceptions of the power of the president or the power of the vice president, explain how a bill becomes a law. OK. I believe that the best way the system works is when the power is with the people to then advocate for their needs and have their needs met. So that's the big macro stepping back, right? One of the ways that the system works to do that, that the system should work to do that, is we have elected representation who represent the people in these state legislatures, which is where laws get passed, or in Congress, which is where the federal laws get passed. And for the system to work the right way, legislators, these members of the state legislature, let's say your state senator, your state assembly member, or your congressman, or your United States senator, will meet with. And they'll have ways of receiving information from the people about what they want. I think it's really important always that we know our power to organize around what we need. And sometimes that'll take the form of writing letters. Sometimes it will take the form of mass protests to make sure the voice of the people is heard by their representative leaders, who then have as their responsibility to write up some legislation that meets the needs of the people. And then when they write that up, they take a vote in their body, if it's a state house or Congress. And if the majority of the people there agree with it, it becomes a law. So that's how it's supposed to work. And I mean, it does connect to what we were talking about earlier, which is then reminding folks, they have a right and a right to expect that their leaders will hear them and take seriously their needs. A lot of why I think it's important to talk about our accomplishments on things like, we finally let Medicare negotiate drug prices with the big pharmaceutical companies so that we could cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month. You know why that's important? Because forever that never happened. And when we explained to people that they kept advocating and kept fighting for it to happen, and it did happen, it reminds people, don't give up. Keep fighting for the things you know are possible, even if it's never happened before. I think it's important for people to know. You know, when we, like for example, I helped write the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act when I was in the United States Senate. People by the hundreds of thousands marched rightly out of pain, out of knowledge, out of commitment, that we need to take seriously what we got to do to deal with this system. And so we couldn't get enough votes to pass it, but we got it that far that we wrote it up. And we got it as far as so that under our administration, the president was able to sign an executive order that put a lot of what we put in the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act into an executive order. So at least for federal law enforcement, we're now dealing with no-knock warrants. We're now talking about a national database for police officers who have committed misconduct. To the people who say, why are we still marching in 2024? When there's common sense what people need, what do you say to that? Look, my parents marched for civil rights back in the day. I do believe there is no significant progress that we've made in our country without the people often taking to the streets. Going way back to the Civil Rights Act, to the Voting Rights Act, to, you know, I mean, what's happening now in the streets on choice, to what happened around George Floyd's murder and moving forward in the agenda that's about that. I mean, you could just go through just the different levels of progress that we've had. Often it has taken people taking to the streets, which is why, look, I support the right of people to peacefully protest. My opponent in this race, you look up Project 2025. Nasty work. They're literally talking about what they would do to arrest people and deport them because they want to suppress. Part of what really concerns me about this moment in time is we've also defined our progress over the years and therefore our strength is being about the expansion of rights. And now we're seeing a full-on intent to restrict rights. Going backwards. I strongly believe we have to always be vigilant, meaning whatever gains we've made, they will not be permanent unless we stay on it. Right. You gotta know you can't take any of our rights for granted. And that's why we have to stay active. And that's about voting. That's about being involved in community organizations. That's about having those conversations when everybody gets together, whether it be at the barbershop or on the kitchen table, to remind ourselves about, look, what's happening and what do we need to do about it? And also think too, I mean, some of the stuff that we stand and fight for, I do it as a parent. In my lifetime, I may not see the benefits, but I have seven kids who are gonna have more kids that are coming down the pipeline that may one day, I'm sure when your parents spot they're thinking by the time my daughter's old enough, hopefully she won't be going through this. That's exactly right. But see, they also taught me this. Don't fall asleep on this stuff. Don't fall asleep on it. Don't sit back and get comfortable. Like, oh, that's done. You know, there's this old saying, it's Coretta Scott King. She said, and I paraphrase it all the time, the fight for civil rights, which she meant the fight for justice, the fight for equality, must be fought in one with each generation. And I think what she meant is, one, understand, whatever gains we make will not be permanent, and two, therefore you must be vigilant. You gotta stay on top of it. And by the way, don't complain about that. And HBCUs are such a big thing now. And I feel like when things get trendy, they become, everyone wants to talk about it and be a part of it. You were someone who went to an HBCU. As an athlete, I'm just like, it's a great idea, and I wish it was more cooler when I was coming up, but at the same time, I don't think the facilities could have held us. You know what I mean? I was fortunate enough to go to UCLA, and it was like being a professional athlete. And we were speaking to some of the brightest minds come from these HBCUs, but the conditions aren't what some of these other schools are. So the history of our HBCUs is a phenomenal history, which again, was born out of struggle, and people sitting around saying, we're not gonna wait for other people, right? So there were a collection of people that were white and black, and of many different backgrounds, who understood that young, black, bright people were not having equal access to top levels of education. And so in a nutshell, that's how our HBCUs got formed. I attended Howard University, which is one of the oldest. And it built up over the years with its purpose and mission being to create national and international leaders. Had a reputation of doing that, because it did that. But over the years, we also know that our students, HBCU students, don't necessarily, frankly, make the same kind of incomes, that people who go to predominantly white institutions do, don't start out on the same base. So even if they are, they're also taking care of their parents, they're also taking care of their younger siblings, and don't necessarily have the extra to be able to build for the school the endowment, which alumni give to that ends up funding things like a first class program, be it athletic or scientific or something. So a lot of my work, especially in the Senate and now as vice president has been to increase federal funding to HBCUs, because again, I know they are centers of academic excellence. They are centers of academic excellence, but don't necessarily have the same kind of resources. And so far we've given now, and our administration, as I've been vice president, $16 billion more dollars to our HBCUs. When I was senator, I was responsible for helping to get billions into upgrading literally the physical structure, because they're old. Yeah, yeah. And I think increasingly to your point, more people are understanding. It's like we may be skipped an era, but we're getting back to a place of more people understanding what our HBCUs do, and giving more support financially to them. But we have to, I mean, it's an incredible experience to walk on campus and everybody looks like you. Right. To go to class and to have a teacher who takes none of your excuses. Mm-hmm. Reminds you of your mom was right. That's exactly right. It reminds you that, no, you just have to work harder. You just have to compete. You'll be the class president if you do that. And the other thing that's great about an HBCU, you could be the class president at the football star. Mm-hmm, same. You could be in a sorority and be the head of the science club. Like it also, the beauty of HBCUs is every signal it sends you is telling you, do not confine yourself to somebody's idea of what it means for you to be a young black person in America. I wanna touch on mental health. Mental health is big in the black community, especially with black men. We have a lot of black men out here who start in grassroots organizations to help their communities. I'll give you an example. A guy named Zeke, he's the building chapter that's called New Era. And all over Detroit, the Bay Area, the Texas area, and what they're doing is they're taking care of the communities. Regardless of race, if somebody's been mistreated, if a store been mistreated, if somebody's been mistreated in that community, they're going hand in hand zone, 19 keys, and also another Zeke. Is it anything that you're thinking about that can help these people that's building these grassroots that actually get stuff done on the ground? Absolutely. I think, first of all, I think the mental health issue is probably one of the biggest public policy failures in our country. We have acted as though healthcare is, we've acted as though the body starts from the neck down. Instead, Annie, we need healthcare also from the neck up. And it has to be done in a way that gives people the dignity and the respect they deserve. The most effective mental healthcare is often because it is peer-based, it is without judgment, and it understands people have to be understood for who they are culturally, who they are in terms of their life experience, if you're really gonna be able to get into their needs. I worked with a brother here in DC, Kier, who actually has been doing a lot around modeling, in particular, and I had him come in a couple years ago, actually, and we've been talking about how we focused, in particular, on our black men and our young black men. Because we also have to take the stigma away. And so part of that is about reminding people, it's just like, if you break your arm or you got a toothache, this is about healthcare. And helping people understand it's a sign of strength to ask for help, not a sign of weakness. Because when we talk about mental healthcare, a lot of it, especially for people who have experienced trauma, we're talking about pain. And we understand physical pain. The mental. Take an aspirin, whatever. But we don't deal with mental and emotional pain in the same way, and here's the thing, first of all, look, growing up in poverty, trauma inducing. Major. Growing up around any form of violence, which crosses socioeconomic lines by the way, so let's not act as though it's just right, blowing up people. Everywhere. Everywhere, trauma inducing. And the thing about it is, when we talk about post-traumatic stress disorder, what happens when you've been repeatedly exposed to trauma? Somebody explained it to me years ago. It's oversimplified, but I'm gonna offer you this. So imagine you're walking across a busy street every day and a Mack truck comes barreling down. You will produce basically a response, without even reflection, you'll jump back. If every day you walk across to me, you overproduce the thing. So that one day you're walking across that street, that Mack truck has come barreling down, you see it, and you keep walking. And then we start talking about our young people don't have emotions. None to it. As though they've chosen. As though they have chosen to not have emotion. And we don't realize that a lot of it is physiological, literally, it's how the body learns to protect itself. And for our youngest children, then what does that mean? They start acting out in class. What happens? They get kicked out of class. They're the bad kid. They still start self identifying that way. And we know where that leads. A lot of the work I did years ago when I was actually DA of San Francisco was focused on a project that we, it ended up developing something to what we call the San Francisco Wellness Center, which was focused on early detection of childhood trauma so that we could get the diagnosis going for the treatment. Because if you don't diagnose it, you can't treat it. And I actually brought in mental health care professionals to talk with public school teachers about it. Like this is what you're seeing in the classroom and help people put a label on it as the first step to diagnosing it. And then getting the treatment. During the time I've been vice president as part of the work we've done on gun violence, we've put now millions of extra dollars in public schools to put more mental health professionals in our public schools. But we need to do a lot more. Because again, it just needs to be diagnosed and treated. Right? And understanding this is not about some child who is bad. It's not some child who wants to act out. It's not, this is not, this is not a choice that child is making. It's an effect. And it's not a choice this child is making. They're actually in pain. And it manifests itself in ways that are anti-social potentially. But the child's in pain. You don't know how to get it out. It's defense mechanism. I have a question along the mental health line. We spoke to Kobe and did his last interview and I asked him over his long career, was there any negativity or hatred or disrespect toward you that he heard and hurt? And he said, I heard it all. And he said that it all hurt. As someone who's been the first in a lot of spaces you've been in, a woman of color knocking on the door to possibly be the next president, how do you protect your mental health and your mental space? Well, number one rule, don't read the comments. The nasty, the nasty. I'm serious. Don't read the comments. Just let's start there. I work out every morning. I work out every morning. For me, it's just mind, body and spirit. I think it's really important for everybody. We all have our levels of strength. Everybody does, right? Be intentional about who you have in your life to the extent you can. And in particular for our young people who may not know that they have a right to be intentional about, do you have people in your life who applaud your success? Do you have people in your life who you trust? Do you have people in your life who when you trip and fall they laugh with you and then they pick you up and push you back out there? There are people that you know who will be those people if you choose to have them. I am blessed to have an incredible family and incredible friends. My best friend from kindergarten is still one of my best friends. You are, that's crazy. Right? Stacy Johnson. Yeah, that's dope. I love it. We used to go to the clubs and hurt Father Seville. And so I think that's part of it, right? Because you do need the support to deal with it. And especially, I mean, people who are active on social media, it's hard out there. It's tough. It's tough. And you have to find things like I love to cook. I love to cook. And it's a way for me to one, I think it's just for me it's a great gift I can give the people I love. But it's also, you know, it's like I start out, I know what I'm gonna make, and then I'm done and I can give it to people. And it just gives me something to do that is a productive use of time. You know, and I think people, you know, choose hobbies, think about what it is that you like to do that takes your mind off of. The stresses that is also productive, right? Economy, small business, black business. We actually just started our business in January. So we're, you know, we've grown from a show to a whole entire company. What is your kind of your economic plan moving forward for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and struggling for groceries and rent and homeowners? So look, I grew up, so my sister and I were raised by our mother. We lived for a long time in an apartment on top of a childcare center. That childcare center was actually owned by a woman who lived two doors down from us, Mrs. Shelton, who was by all of our accounts and feelings, our second mother, she helped raise us. And so she was a small business owner. So I'll start with the small business and congratulations. I want you guys to. Thank you, thank you. I, from a child, knew who our small business owners are, right? I mean, you're business leaders, but you're also civic leaders. You take seriously your voice in how you can mentor, how you can grow, right? Communities and the sense of communities. I love our small businesses. And so a lot of my work in terms of building and growing the economy has focused on small businesses. And my vision overall is we need to build an opportunity economy in which we increase opportunity for all, including small business owners. So a lot of my work, even in the Senate, was about increasing access to capital through our small businesses, and in particular through our community banks. So I've been responsible for billions of dollars more now going into our community banks because they're in the community and then they know who's in the community and where the talent is and who's doing good in the community, what the community wants. And so part of my plan as president is to give small businesses startups a tax deduction of $50,000 to start up. Because right now the tax deduction is $5,000. Can't do nothing with that. That's exactly right. And see the thing we know is that most of our small business, our entrepreneurs who want to start a small business got a great idea, have incredible work ethic, but they weren't handed a bunch of money on a silver tray. And they just need to get their foot in the door. So there is that. There is what I need to do and what we need to do around making housing and rent more affordable. Part of the problem there is we have a housing supply shortage. My plan includes giving tax incentives for home builders to build 3 million more homes by the end of my first term to increase supply to bring down cost. And to increase home ownership, a $25,000 down payment assistance to first-time home buyers. Because again, people just need to get their foot in the door. They'll grind after that. Right? That's exactly right. They'll grind after that. That's exactly right. And we know home ownership, especially for the community, that's the fastest, most effective, and most sure ways to build intergenerational wealth. It's then when your child says, I want to go to an HBC or some other college, and you say, well, honey, you don't have to take out a student loan, I'm going to take some equity out of the house. Or your child says, I want to start up a small business and you can say, let me take some equity and help you. Right? First, what is that business? Let me make sure it's not no belt plan. But you know what I'm saying. Yeah, I could just say, you have something to pull from. Right, you have something where it's about intergenerational wealth. See, here's how I feel about the economy and the economy I want to grow. We have, over the last four years, reduced black unemployment to the lowest it has been in decades. That is an accomplishment. However, we, I believe, need to measure our success, not just only about everybody's working, but can you build wealth? Can you start saving? Can you start saving? Can you buy a home? Can you start saving to take your family on vacation from time to time? Can you save enough so that Christmas time for you and your children is not stressful, but something enjoyable? And so it's about, yes, we got to make sure that we have high employment, but also that we create opportunities for people to build wealth. Get ahead. Part of my plan is also to expand the child tax credit. $6,000 in the first year of your child's life. Man, I could have used that one. Because you know what that means. First year, that's such a critical stage of a child's development. And it's expensive. A family's got to buy a car seat, a crib, the clothes, the things that... The necessities. Because I start from the perspective that the vast majority of parents want to raise their children well. They love their children. But don't necessarily have the resources they need. And if we understand that the children of a community are the children of the community, we'll understand that an investment in something like the first year of a child's life benefits all of us. But these are things about building what I call an opportunity economy, which is about helping people not just to get by, but to get ahead. Because most people, look, maybe you've gathered this already. Here's where I come from. Most people have ambition. They have aspirations. They have dreams. And they are willing to work hard. And if we give people the opportunity to actually meet those goals, they jump for it every time. But not everybody starts out from the same place in terms of having the opportunity to just get in there. And so my plans, whether it be $25,000 down payment assistance, whether it be a $6,000 child tax credit, or helping people in terms of what they need to do to be able to start a small business with a bigger tax deduction. The reason I'm saying all that is because when those folks are successful, we are all successful. The community feels it. And we actually strengthen the economy overall. When middle class is strong in America, America's economy is strong. It's a better country. And it's a better country for all of us. All right, so we're running short on time. We're gonna finish up with quick hitters. First thing to come to mind, let us know. Oh, cannabis? Your views on cannabis here. I just feel strongly people should not be going to jail for smoking weed. And we know historically what that has meant and who has gone to jail. Second, I just think we have come to a point where we have to understand that we need to legalize it and stop criminalizing this behavior. And so, and I've, actually, this is not a new position for me. I have felt for a long time we need to legalize it. So that's where I am on that. I love it. Okay. She said weed and not cannabis. Pay attention, y'all. Yeah, that's old school, right? Yeah, that's old school. I like it. I like it. All right. I loved it. Favorite holiday to cook and what's your signature dish? Well, Sundays are my favorite days to cook. Sunday family dinner. I mean, these days it's more difficult for me than ever. But Sunday family dinner, I get everybody together. My happy place and whoever's around, bring your friends. Oh, party. I'm leaving my number. I want to get invited to one of these Sunday dinners. I'll be back. Okay, you guys are welcome. Yes. Best musical artist in Bay Area history. Put her on the spot. Oh, ever? Now my mind is going through lots and I mean, I'll just, I could go with too short, but I mean. You can't go wrong with too short. Yeah. Rafael Sadeed. Rafael is so. Matt Dre. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you know Tupac had his. Yeah, he was drawing. He claims Matt, he claims they're 40. Five dinner guests that are alive. I'm going to get emotional when I say it's my mother and my husband never met. Oh, okay. My mother passed away before we got married. So if I could put him at the table with my mother. Shirley Chisholm. First black woman to run for president. Oh, and I would so love to sit with her. I would so love to sit with her. I mean, I feel that I know her because I have studied her life. You're walking in a footsteps. And yes, that a path that she created, right? It's a beautiful thing. One of my heroes is Thurgood Marshall. You know, and you talk about like him being active in the streets and what he did in terms of representation and then went to the court and carried that over. Big. Who's that last seat going to? You know who I saw recently who I just loved, but he's one of two, the Justins from Tennessee. They refused to be silenced. They were both in the state capital. And they were speaking up about gun violence. And then the other legislators tried to shut them down. And Justin Jones is actually from Oakland and born where I was born at Kaiser Hospital, Oakland, California. Yeah, that would be kind of a good mix because then that's kind of different generations of leaders. First thing you do in the morning, last thing you do for you go to sleep. First thing I do in the morning is work out. There is a prayer that comes in after that. Yes, of course. Every day. And last thing, usually to tell my husband I love him. I like that. What's your guilty pleasure? Do you have any? Yes. One of my guilty pleasures, especially when I'm on the road are my Doritos. What flavor? Nacho. Nacho. Old school original. Come on, come on. Oh gee, red bag. Yeah, that's exactly right. Red bag. You gotta have a napkin nearby. That would be better. Yeah, I love it. What was your process because it was fast? What was your process and what did you do when you were deciding who to pick for your vice president? You know ultimately what it came down to was Tim Walls. If you look at Tim Walls and you look at me and you have a sense of who we are and where we came from, you think we have nothing in common. But his, you know, he comes from and grew up in the same kind of, you know, different part of the country. You know, folks were a different color from a different culture, but same people. Hardworking people, straight talking people. People who have values. And I just found that so familiar to me. And I guess that the process was ultimately I made a decision about my gut around like, do you, not that any of the other candidates didn't, but just do you, do you have a connection to the people and in a life experience that is about just seeing people and, but it was a whole thing. I mean, it was- But I heard you did some cooking. You were trying to watch a movie and couldn't focus. Like, is that your, that's what I want. Yes, well, so okay. So you better know that part. Give me that, yeah. Look, from the time that the president called me and told me he wasn't running, I mean, it just like everything was in speedy, speedy motion. And I was not sleeping so well. And that one morning, I just, I mean, I had, I don't know, a few hours sleep and I, you know, I'd like to sleep. I just got up, I was like, and so I just went out and got a pork roast and started to marinate. See what kind of work, get in your happy place. And my family happened to be in town so they were very happy about the whole situation. But I just got up and started, everybody's asleep, I just got up and started cooking. Set your mind to your surroundings. Last question, as someone who's broke a ton of barriers throughout your journey and your journeys continuing to elevate, what does it mean to you to be the first woman president but the first black woman as president? Well, not there yet, not good. My mother had many sayings and one of them is she would say to me in Kamala, you may be the first to do many things, make sure you're not the last. And I take that so very seriously. I've had the good fortune to mentor a lot of people along the way, including to this day. For me, it's about one understanding the shoulders I stand on. We talk about a Shirley Chisholm and then so many people who are alive, who have mentored me and helped me up. And I just, I feel so strongly that, you know, each one pull one. You got to leave that door open more than it was when you walked in. And that's what it means to me. It's, I feel a great sense of responsibility. I mean, you talk about your daughter and what she's doing at school. I look at our sons, I look at, I mean, I feel a sense of responsibility to hopefully remind them that you should never hear no. You should never hear nobody like you has done this before or it's not your time or they're not ready. Like don't hear that. Don't hear that. I eat no for breakfast. That's my saying. I eat no for breakfast. You got to see it to believe it. We talked about that growing up in the communities. You got to see it to believe it. We've seen Obama do what he does and now we have an opportunity to possibly see you. And to me, you know, five, six daughters and you know, I have a daughter just to be able to see it. I mean, so much. Right, well, because there's so many, it's sadly, but there's so much good in the world. So let's start with that. And there's so many positive messages. And there are some that are not positive. And that would suggest to our kids, to our young people that they're alone, that they don't have champions, that they don't belong, that they're not entitled to, that they don't have rights, including the right to be a leader. Right. And I hope that in my career and in my work, to the extent I am able to help people reject that, that I can do that. I love it. Before we get out of here, we would like to give you our first ever coffee. Oh, you're kidding. First coffee, ever have a coffee table book, Simon and Schuster. We did a partnership with them. So we want to sign this. Please do. For you. Oh my goodness, that's wonderful. So this is a lot of new stuff happening for you guys. Yeah. Making our way. What is the name of the company? All the smoke productions. Okay, so productions adding that. Yeah, I just added it to the end. Oh, that's wonderful. Thank you all. It's one of the stories of some of our favorite guests and they're thinking everything from mental health to family to business to basketball to... I'm so glad you guys are, I mean, on everything but on the mental health piece. Yeah, I think it's huge. Because that's especially coming from the two of you and the folks that you'll bring on. We just need to remind people that it's actually, like this is about self-help. Yeah. Right? Like stop suffering. Yeah. And I think too we... We live in with so much suffering. We've all came, we came from as low as you can be and made it out. So to inspire and to let people know it is okay to ask for help is important. But... But here's the other thing if I can just add to that. I think we have a system that fails people if only the exceptional can get out. Mm-hmm. It's a great point. Right? That's a failure of a system. Because then people say, oh, but this person and that person, no. If you're pointing to the exceptional and that's the only success story you've got. Forgetting about the majority. That's a failure of a system. Good point. Key word is opportunity. You said it. Yeah. People always ask, what's the difference between you and George Floyd? We grew up in the same area, did the same things. But I had the opportunity to go play basketball. That's right. He didn't have an opportunity to get out the ghetto. So that was the only difference in our areas is opportunity. Everybody don't have the same opportunity. That's exactly right. And that's what we gotta give back to. That's exactly right. Agreed. Because if you didn't have that skill but you had other skills. I would have been to step right there with him. Right, exactly right. Exactly right. How's his daughter doing? She's doing great. She's doing great. She is. John is doing real good. She's back in school. She's in school but sometimes she'll hear something that'll bring her back to that place. Did she get counseling? Yep, and she has a great sports system. She has a great sports system. And her uncle is so wonderful. Everybody has done things for her. She's definitely reaping the benefits of it. So it's been a blessing for her. Tell her I asked about it. I definitely will. You know I will. I will. Yeah, we should have her come back to when she's on break. She'll be happy to hear that. She's a sweet child. She really is. And handled all that attention. That's true. In every way, because that was a lot. In every direction. From even people who wanted to give her love and support. But that was a lot for a child of that age. There was no blueprint. She picked me up a lot of days. A lot of days where I didn't know what I was doing. Just hearing her call me uncle and just tell me she loved me. Those days picked me up a lot. So she is definitely a special child. Gave her hope. Yeah, she's a special child. We are all a work in progress. Yes, yes. We really are. And no blueprint to it. Not at all. We are making it up as we go along. But still breaking the glass ceiling. Still breaking the glass ceiling. Well, that's a wrap. Thank you for having us in your home. We appreciate you. You know you're very busy, but sitting down and talking to us and talking to the people. And we wish you the very best moving forward. I thank you both. I thank you. I look forward to talking again. Thank you. That's a wrap. You can catch this on All the Smoke YouTube. We'll see you guys next week.",full,8780
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"Welcome back to All The Smoke. We got a very special guest today. Very excited to sit down and talk to.. Our biggest guest. Yeah. I wouldn't lie about that. Yeah, you solely show I do it over. Nah, you did it. So we didn't do nothing of them. Excuse me. Our biggest guest, I've been corrected, Miss Madam Vice President. Thank you. It is so good to be with you guys. Thank you for sitting down with us. Thank you for having us in your home. We're excited to be here. Thank you both. Thank you both. I'm so happy to have you here. Thank you. You do me great honor to be here. Thank you. In 2013, a blind date with your now husband, Doug, if you think back to that date and now we're here, did you ever imagine this was going to be the journey? No, I just have a really bossy best friend. It was a blind date, right? It was a blind date. And she called me up because she and her husband met him and got to know him. And then she just decided that this might co-work and said to me, just go out with him once. Don't Google him. Just go out with him. Don't Google him. Just give it a shot. Yeah, right? And it turned out she was right. And I am in a very happy marriage. I'm very thankful to say it. So where'd you guys go? Did you really eat? Or did you just do a salad? Like, did you really let your hair down and have fun? So he came to pick me up. OK. What kind of car? A BMW. Uh-oh, OK. Move it in style. OK, but here's the thing. That was actually really funny in retrospect. I gave him the car and he said, I just need to tell you something. And I'm like, OK, what's this going to be? And he said, I'm a really bad driver. Gave you the heads up, huh? So that's how it started. I guess he was just trying to create low expectations. And we went to what turned out to be his one favorite restaurant where everybody knows who he is, which is obviously very smart. So he was showing you off there. Oh, yeah. So he could walk in and they were like, hey, Doug. I see you, Doug. Uh-huh. All right. Exactly. Bay Area Girl. Yeah. Born in Oakland. You grew up around the TMC Times.",chunk_1,422
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"Yeah. Going to stay at the Warriors. We hear you a big fan. I am. And there was a rumor that you were in the stands when we were there and we believe ERA. I really, what? Yes, yes. I do remember. I do remember. OK, we want to say our warriors are always good, whichever era. But that was a very special time. I mean, it was electric. You guys remember. It was electric. And everybody, we would take Bart to get there and just and go. And it was just, you know, I mean, this is the thing I love about sports in general. But I'm going to say my warriors, our warriors, is that it really was about bringing like all kinds of people from around the Bay Area. And you know, the Bay Area is a melting pot, right? Yeah. All coming in. And that team, I mean, you guys were the best of the best. Legendary. Legendary. You know, it's funny not to cut you off, as I went back in 2017 with Steph and Katie and those guys. And we won a championship right before I retired. But they all wanted to know about that. We believed in the era and the energy around the city. And when I was there, the media was talking about it. The fans were talking about it. And as amazing as that team was and won all the championships, they had a fascination in what we did. What was it like for you guys? For me, it was big for me because I had had some trouble two years before. So I needed to come into a situation where I needed to change. Yeah. And it was a blessing in disguise for me. You know, I landed with a whole bunch of guys I knew. I landed with a coach that didn't judge me, that let me be me. Yeah. And we were able to make history. So it was a blessing for me. Yeah, I think too. I mean, it was almost a melting pot of guys that my career could have been over before it started. That's where I really first got my chance with Don Nelson. Like he said, he was coming off trouble. One of our other brothers, Baron Davis, was very talented. But injuries, it didn't really know what was going on. So it just kind of felt like the Bay put their arms around us. We were out in the streets hanging out from San Francisco to Oakland to Richmond.",chunk_2,428
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"Probably every club that opened. Yeah, we were there. Fill more. Give us a fill more. They called us to fill more. Yeah, we're out. We were just embracing the community. But I mean, one thing I'll say about the Bay Area fans is like you said, you always want to say they were good. But there was times where they were terrible, but the support never wavered. You guys were so loyal to the fan. Yes. I just, I mean, first of all, loyalty is a general matter in life. I think is one of the most important. Growing up, my mother used to say, you got to have a code. Got to. Got to stand for something. And you figure out what your code is. But loyalty. And then loyalty to your team, right? I mean, nobody like. This is fancy. Yeah, you know. They got the emblem on it and everything, huh? Yes, I do. Look at this. There's like some presidential water right here. As you were saying, excuse me. You got to be loyal to your team. Like my husband and I have different teams. Is he from the Bay two? Well, he's really from Jersey. But he moved to LA when he was a teenager. So most of his fans are LA teams. And so, depending on who's playing, who and what time of the year it is, it's very like really real. Like talking some serious smack. What's your feelings on all three of the teams out of Oakland now? Oh, it breaks my heart. It breaks my heart. Remember, we used to have all of them. You know, and you just drive by that area, you know, when I go to Oakland, when I go to the Bay Area. It's sad. You know, if you like land at Oakland Airport and just pass Coliseum, it is. It breaks my heart. Yeah. And good, good teams. Yeah. Right? For us, I think as players, when our time, we more worried about the workers and the people that were there. Because that's who made us feel good. That's exactly right. The workers, every day we came in there, we saw those smiles. We got hugs by people. Actually, from Oakland. And to see them lose them jobs to San Francisco, yeah, that really didn't happen. You're so right. It was part of the economic engine of Oakland.",chunk_3,403
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And then the vendors, and it was, you know, and it was local folks, small businesses. Yeah. I'll definitely say, I mean, obviously we understand what that era and that team kind of did. They took the team to a new level, and the business side kicked in. Yeah, it really did. I love where they're at in San Francisco, a beautiful stadium, but there'll never be anything like Oracle. Never. No. And I'm always going to go to the same place. No, and I'm always going to think, you know, I mean, Golden State Warriors is Oakland. That's what you think. That's Oakland. That's what you think. I grew up Italian mom, black dad, and was always very proud of my heritage until an incident I had in high school when I was 17, protecting my little sister. Someone called her some names. I did what the big brother did. I ended up getting in trouble in the KKK, came to vandalize, nearly burned down my high school. And I knew at that point, although I was very proud to be Italian and black, that the world looked at me as a black man. You've always been secure in your identity, who you are. But what do you feel or what do you think when you hear people kind of questioning just the fabric of who you are? Well, one, I don't listen to it. I'm really clear about who I am. And if anybody else is not, they need to go through their own level of therapy. That's not my issue. My mother was very clear. She was raising two black girls to be two proud black women. And that was never, it was never a question. You know, it's funny, because over the years, journalists, some, not most, will want to talk about it. And I say, OK, if you want to have this conversation, I'm prepared to have it. But sit down and get comfortable for a few hours. If you want to start talking about race in America, you want to talk about the 1A rule. A drop. You want, right. You want to talk about what it means in terms of who you are perceived to be and the impact that can have on the rest of your life, regardless of who you actually are in terms of your God-given capacity and the rights that you have and should have.",chunk_4,409
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"So, you know, I don't mess with that. I think that's other people trying to figure some stuff out that they need. They got some issues. They got to deal with it. You've also been attacked for not having biological children, but you are a stepmom and I'm a stepfather. I just had my seventh, that little boy two weeks ago, but I have three stepchildren that are mine. And being a dad was natural. Being a dad to my four sons was natural. But learning to navigate, not wanting to step on toes, how do you earn the love and the trust, how did you earn Ella and Cole's love and trust, and how did you get the name Mamala? I'll start with this. I am a daughter of divorced parents. My parents were divorced when I was five. And just being very frank and handed with you, when Doug and I started dating, you know, his parents have been married over 60 years. I had to explain to him what it is like to be a child of divorced parents. And including that it was really important to me that I knew what he and my relationship would be before I formed a relationship with the kids. Because that's just, from my perspective, an experience not fair to the children. Because, you know, children form attachments. So I was very intentional about waiting until I knew that, okay, this is a real relationship before I got to know the kids. And then we became, I mean, thick as thieves. And I love those children. They are my children. And, you know, we talk about, we have a modern family. And maybe the blessing that I have that not everyone has, although I think everyone should try and work on it, is I have a very close, because it is a very respectful relationship with their mother. It's important. You know, and so- That ain't easy. That's rare. No, but it's not. But it's not. It is not. And you have to work at it. You're giving me a hot flash, hold on. But you have to work at it. You'll be all right. Because here's the thing. Here's the thing that we have to remember. And I know we do. And we feel, but we have to be intentional about it.",chunk_5,393
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"Because the forces and the emotions will drag us from this point. The most important thing is that our kids grow up healthy. And, you know, I think of the many things that we role model. Probably the thing we role model the most that we don't realize is how to form healthy relationships. You know, we teach our kids how to drive. We will sit down and do homework with them. But one of the things, we are teaching them every day. And we have to be intentional. By just seeing it. We will not be perfect. We will fall short. But it's how to develop healthy, emotional relationships. One of the ways, especially in that dynamic when you're talking about my husband's ex-wife, is how to be respectful. And I was very intentional about, for example, knowing that the kids, as they got to know and form a relationship with me, would not want to feel like they were somehow being disloyal to their mother. And I knew that. And so I was very intentional about always making sure that I was clear with them that I would say things like, well, how does your mom do it? And I love to cook. How does your mom show me how you do it? And I think that's really important. Because this is the thing that I think has become clear, especially as I'm now running for president. And these kind of conversations are becoming more prevalent. Like, what does it mean to be a step here? The people who don't get it are understanding, is there a whole lot more of these kinds of relationships than people realize? This is not the 1950s. Blended is the new norm. Blended families are the new norm. It is. It is. And they're beautiful. And it's a beautiful way to live. To build and grow your family. You know, I talk about it even in my speech at the convention. I have, and I grew up with, the family that is my family by blood and the family that is my family by love. And sometimes that's thicker. And that's exactly right. That's thicker. That's exactly right. I think increasingly people, especially younger people, understand that, right? That there's the family you're born into, and then there's the family you choose.",chunk_6,390
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"And it's on you to make a decision about what you want and how you define your family. And you have the right to do that. I tell Mike, I'm just an extra layer of support and protection. I'm not there to replace your dad. I'm not there to, you know, I'm here to help in any way possible. And so Mamala came about because that, because it's Kamala. And then I just got created with it. And it's Mamala. I love it. All right, shifting a little bit to policy talk. And before we talk about policy, can you briefly explain, because I think sometimes there's misconceptions of the power of the president or the power of the vice president, explain how a bill becomes a law. OK. I believe that the best way the system works is when the power is with the people to then advocate for their needs and have their needs met. So that's the big macro stepping back, right? One of the ways that the system works to do that, that the system should work to do that, is we have elected representation who represent the people in these state legislatures, which is where laws get passed, or in Congress, which is where the federal laws get passed. And for the system to work the right way, legislators, these members of the state legislature, let's say your state senator, your state assembly member, or your congressman, or your United States senator, will meet with. And they'll have ways of receiving information from the people about what they want. I think it's really important always that we know our power to organize around what we need. And sometimes that'll take the form of writing letters. Sometimes it will take the form of mass protests to make sure the voice of the people is heard by their representative leaders, who then have as their responsibility to write up some legislation that meets the needs of the people. And then when they write that up, they take a vote in their body, if it's a state house or Congress. And if the majority of the people there agree with it, it becomes a law. So that's how it's supposed to work.",chunk_7,374
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"And I mean, it does connect to what we were talking about earlier, which is then reminding folks, they have a right and a right to expect that their leaders will hear them and take seriously their needs. A lot of why I think it's important to talk about our accomplishments on things like, we finally let Medicare negotiate drug prices with the big pharmaceutical companies so that we could cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month. You know why that's important? Because forever that never happened. And when we explained to people that they kept advocating and kept fighting for it to happen, and it did happen, it reminds people, don't give up. Keep fighting for the things you know are possible, even if it's never happened before. I think it's important for people to know. You know, when we, like for example, I helped write the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act when I was in the United States Senate. People by the hundreds of thousands marched rightly out of pain, out of knowledge, out of commitment, that we need to take seriously what we got to do to deal with this system. And so we couldn't get enough votes to pass it, but we got it that far that we wrote it up. And we got it as far as so that under our administration, the president was able to sign an executive order that put a lot of what we put in the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act into an executive order. So at least for federal law enforcement, we're now dealing with no-knock warrants. We're now talking about a national database for police officers who have committed misconduct. To the people who say, why are we still marching in 2024? When there's common sense what people need, what do you say to that? Look, my parents marched for civil rights back in the day. I do believe there is no significant progress that we've made in our country without the people often taking to the streets. Going way back to the Civil Rights Act, to the Voting Rights Act, to, you know, I mean, what's happening now in the streets on choice, to what happened around George Floyd's murder and moving forward in the agenda that's about that.",chunk_8,386
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"I mean, you could just go through just the different levels of progress that we've had. Often it has taken people taking to the streets, which is why, look, I support the right of people to peacefully protest. My opponent in this race, you look up Project 2025. Nasty work. They're literally talking about what they would do to arrest people and deport them because they want to suppress. Part of what really concerns me about this moment in time is we've also defined our progress over the years and therefore our strength is being about the expansion of rights. And now we're seeing a full-on intent to restrict rights. Going backwards. I strongly believe we have to always be vigilant, meaning whatever gains we've made, they will not be permanent unless we stay on it. Right. You gotta know you can't take any of our rights for granted. And that's why we have to stay active. And that's about voting. That's about being involved in community organizations. That's about having those conversations when everybody gets together, whether it be at the barbershop or on the kitchen table, to remind ourselves about, look, what's happening and what do we need to do about it? And also think too, I mean, some of the stuff that we stand and fight for, I do it as a parent. In my lifetime, I may not see the benefits, but I have seven kids who are gonna have more kids that are coming down the pipeline that may one day, I'm sure when your parents spot they're thinking by the time my daughter's old enough, hopefully she won't be going through this. That's exactly right. But see, they also taught me this. Don't fall asleep on this stuff. Don't fall asleep on it. Don't sit back and get comfortable. Like, oh, that's done. You know, there's this old saying, it's Coretta Scott King. She said, and I paraphrase it all the time, the fight for civil rights, which she meant the fight for justice, the fight for equality, must be fought in one with each generation. And I think what she meant is, one, understand, whatever gains we make will not be permanent, and two, therefore you must be vigilant.",chunk_9,376
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"You gotta stay on top of it. And by the way, don't complain about that. And HBCUs are such a big thing now. And I feel like when things get trendy, they become, everyone wants to talk about it and be a part of it. You were someone who went to an HBCU. As an athlete, I'm just like, it's a great idea, and I wish it was more cooler when I was coming up, but at the same time, I don't think the facilities could have held us. You know what I mean? I was fortunate enough to go to UCLA, and it was like being a professional athlete. And we were speaking to some of the brightest minds come from these HBCUs, but the conditions aren't what some of these other schools are. So the history of our HBCUs is a phenomenal history, which again, was born out of struggle, and people sitting around saying, we're not gonna wait for other people, right? So there were a collection of people that were white and black, and of many different backgrounds, who understood that young, black, bright people were not having equal access to top levels of education. And so in a nutshell, that's how our HBCUs got formed. I attended Howard University, which is one of the oldest. And it built up over the years with its purpose and mission being to create national and international leaders. Had a reputation of doing that, because it did that. But over the years, we also know that our students, HBCU students, don't necessarily, frankly, make the same kind of incomes, that people who go to predominantly white institutions do, don't start out on the same base. So even if they are, they're also taking care of their parents, they're also taking care of their younger siblings, and don't necessarily have the extra to be able to build for the school the endowment, which alumni give to that ends up funding things like a first class program, be it athletic or scientific or something. So a lot of my work, especially in the Senate and now as vice president has been to increase federal funding to HBCUs, because again, I know they are centers of academic excellence.",chunk_10,376
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"They are centers of academic excellence, but don't necessarily have the same kind of resources. And so far we've given now, and our administration, as I've been vice president, $16 billion more dollars to our HBCUs. When I was senator, I was responsible for helping to get billions into upgrading literally the physical structure, because they're old. Yeah, yeah. And I think increasingly to your point, more people are understanding. It's like we may be skipped an era, but we're getting back to a place of more people understanding what our HBCUs do, and giving more support financially to them. But we have to, I mean, it's an incredible experience to walk on campus and everybody looks like you. Right. To go to class and to have a teacher who takes none of your excuses. Mm-hmm. Reminds you of your mom was right. That's exactly right. It reminds you that, no, you just have to work harder. You just have to compete. You'll be the class president if you do that. And the other thing that's great about an HBCU, you could be the class president at the football star. Mm-hmm, same. You could be in a sorority and be the head of the science club. Like it also, the beauty of HBCUs is every signal it sends you is telling you, do not confine yourself to somebody's idea of what it means for you to be a young black person in America. I wanna touch on mental health. Mental health is big in the black community, especially with black men. We have a lot of black men out here who start in grassroots organizations to help their communities. I'll give you an example. A guy named Zeke, he's the building chapter that's called New Era. And all over Detroit, the Bay Area, the Texas area, and what they're doing is they're taking care of the communities. Regardless of race, if somebody's been mistreated, if a store been mistreated, if somebody's been mistreated in that community, they're going hand in hand zone, 19 keys, and also another Zeke. Is it anything that you're thinking about that can help these people that's building these grassroots that actually get stuff done on the ground? Absolutely.",chunk_11,373
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"I think, first of all, I think the mental health issue is probably one of the biggest public policy failures in our country. We have acted as though healthcare is, we've acted as though the body starts from the neck down. Instead, Annie, we need healthcare also from the neck up. And it has to be done in a way that gives people the dignity and the respect they deserve. The most effective mental healthcare is often because it is peer-based, it is without judgment, and it understands people have to be understood for who they are culturally, who they are in terms of their life experience, if you're really gonna be able to get into their needs. I worked with a brother here in DC, Kier, who actually has been doing a lot around modeling, in particular, and I had him come in a couple years ago, actually, and we've been talking about how we focused, in particular, on our black men and our young black men. Because we also have to take the stigma away. And so part of that is about reminding people, it's just like, if you break your arm or you got a toothache, this is about healthcare. And helping people understand it's a sign of strength to ask for help, not a sign of weakness. Because when we talk about mental healthcare, a lot of it, especially for people who have experienced trauma, we're talking about pain. And we understand physical pain. The mental. Take an aspirin, whatever. But we don't deal with mental and emotional pain in the same way, and here's the thing, first of all, look, growing up in poverty, trauma inducing. Major. Growing up around any form of violence, which crosses socioeconomic lines by the way, so let's not act as though it's just right, blowing up people. Everywhere. Everywhere, trauma inducing. And the thing about it is, when we talk about post-traumatic stress disorder, what happens when you've been repeatedly exposed to trauma? Somebody explained it to me years ago. It's oversimplified, but I'm gonna offer you this. So imagine you're walking across a busy street every day and a Mack truck comes barreling down.",chunk_12,366
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"You will produce basically a response, without even reflection, you'll jump back. If every day you walk across to me, you overproduce the thing. So that one day you're walking across that street, that Mack truck has come barreling down, you see it, and you keep walking. And then we start talking about our young people don't have emotions. None to it. As though they've chosen. As though they have chosen to not have emotion. And we don't realize that a lot of it is physiological, literally, it's how the body learns to protect itself. And for our youngest children, then what does that mean? They start acting out in class. What happens? They get kicked out of class. They're the bad kid. They still start self identifying that way. And we know where that leads. A lot of the work I did years ago when I was actually DA of San Francisco was focused on a project that we, it ended up developing something to what we call the San Francisco Wellness Center, which was focused on early detection of childhood trauma so that we could get the diagnosis going for the treatment. Because if you don't diagnose it, you can't treat it. And I actually brought in mental health care professionals to talk with public school teachers about it. Like this is what you're seeing in the classroom and help people put a label on it as the first step to diagnosing it. And then getting the treatment. During the time I've been vice president as part of the work we've done on gun violence, we've put now millions of extra dollars in public schools to put more mental health professionals in our public schools. But we need to do a lot more. Because again, it just needs to be diagnosed and treated. Right? And understanding this is not about some child who is bad. It's not some child who wants to act out. It's not, this is not, this is not a choice that child is making. It's an effect. And it's not a choice this child is making. They're actually in pain. And it manifests itself in ways that are anti-social potentially. But the child's in pain.",chunk_13,371
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"You don't know how to get it out. It's defense mechanism. I have a question along the mental health line. We spoke to Kobe and did his last interview and I asked him over his long career, was there any negativity or hatred or disrespect toward you that he heard and hurt? And he said, I heard it all. And he said that it all hurt. As someone who's been the first in a lot of spaces you've been in, a woman of color knocking on the door to possibly be the next president, how do you protect your mental health and your mental space? Well, number one rule, don't read the comments. The nasty, the nasty. I'm serious. Don't read the comments. Just let's start there. I work out every morning. I work out every morning. For me, it's just mind, body and spirit. I think it's really important for everybody. We all have our levels of strength. Everybody does, right? Be intentional about who you have in your life to the extent you can. And in particular for our young people who may not know that they have a right to be intentional about, do you have people in your life who applaud your success? Do you have people in your life who you trust? Do you have people in your life who when you trip and fall they laugh with you and then they pick you up and push you back out there? There are people that you know who will be those people if you choose to have them. I am blessed to have an incredible family and incredible friends. My best friend from kindergarten is still one of my best friends. You are, that's crazy. Right? Stacy Johnson. Yeah, that's dope. I love it. We used to go to the clubs and hurt Father Seville. And so I think that's part of it, right? Because you do need the support to deal with it. And especially, I mean, people who are active on social media, it's hard out there. It's tough. It's tough. And you have to find things like I love to cook. I love to cook. And it's a way for me to one, I think it's just for me it's a great gift I can give the people I love. But it's also, you know, it's like I start out, I know what I'm gonna make, and then I'm done and I can give it to people.",chunk_14,415
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"And it just gives me something to do that is a productive use of time. You know, and I think people, you know, choose hobbies, think about what it is that you like to do that takes your mind off of. The stresses that is also productive, right? Economy, small business, black business. We actually just started our business in January. So we're, you know, we've grown from a show to a whole entire company. What is your kind of your economic plan moving forward for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and struggling for groceries and rent and homeowners? So look, I grew up, so my sister and I were raised by our mother. We lived for a long time in an apartment on top of a childcare center. That childcare center was actually owned by a woman who lived two doors down from us, Mrs. Shelton, who was by all of our accounts and feelings, our second mother, she helped raise us. And so she was a small business owner. So I'll start with the small business and congratulations. I want you guys to. Thank you, thank you. I, from a child, knew who our small business owners are, right? I mean, you're business leaders, but you're also civic leaders. You take seriously your voice in how you can mentor, how you can grow, right? Communities and the sense of communities. I love our small businesses. And so a lot of my work in terms of building and growing the economy has focused on small businesses. And my vision overall is we need to build an opportunity economy in which we increase opportunity for all, including small business owners. So a lot of my work, even in the Senate, was about increasing access to capital through our small businesses, and in particular through our community banks. So I've been responsible for billions of dollars more now going into our community banks because they're in the community and then they know who's in the community and where the talent is and who's doing good in the community, what the community wants. And so part of my plan as president is to give small businesses startups a tax deduction of $50,000 to start up.",chunk_15,375
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"Because right now the tax deduction is $5,000. Can't do nothing with that. That's exactly right. And see the thing we know is that most of our small business, our entrepreneurs who want to start a small business got a great idea, have incredible work ethic, but they weren't handed a bunch of money on a silver tray. And they just need to get their foot in the door. So there is that. There is what I need to do and what we need to do around making housing and rent more affordable. Part of the problem there is we have a housing supply shortage. My plan includes giving tax incentives for home builders to build 3 million more homes by the end of my first term to increase supply to bring down cost. And to increase home ownership, a $25,000 down payment assistance to first-time home buyers. Because again, people just need to get their foot in the door. They'll grind after that. Right? That's exactly right. They'll grind after that. That's exactly right. And we know home ownership, especially for the community, that's the fastest, most effective, and most sure ways to build intergenerational wealth. It's then when your child says, I want to go to an HBC or some other college, and you say, well, honey, you don't have to take out a student loan, I'm going to take some equity out of the house. Or your child says, I want to start up a small business and you can say, let me take some equity and help you. Right? First, what is that business? Let me make sure it's not no belt plan. But you know what I'm saying. Yeah, I could just say, you have something to pull from. Right, you have something where it's about intergenerational wealth. See, here's how I feel about the economy and the economy I want to grow. We have, over the last four years, reduced black unemployment to the lowest it has been in decades. That is an accomplishment. However, we, I believe, need to measure our success, not just only about everybody's working, but can you build wealth? Can you start saving? Can you start saving? Can you buy a home? Can you start saving to take your family on vacation from time to time? Can you save enough so that Christmas time for you and your children is not stressful, but something enjoyable? And so it's about, yes, we got to make sure that we have high employment, but also that we create opportunities for people to build wealth.",chunk_16,432
2024-09-30,Podcast,,chunk,"Get ahead. Part of my plan is also to expand the child tax credit. $6,000 in the first year of your child's life. Man, I could have used that one. Because you know what that means. First year, that's such a critical stage of a child's development. And it's expensive. A family's got to buy a car seat, a crib, the clothes, the things that.. The necessities. Because I start from the perspective that the vast majority of parents want to raise their children well. They love their children. But don't necessarily have the resources they need. And if we understand that the children of a community are the children of the community, we'll understand that an investment in something like the first year of a child's life benefits all of us. But these are things about building what I call an opportunity economy, which is about helping people not just to get by, but to get ahead. Because most people, look, maybe you've gathered this already. Here's where I come from. Most people have ambition. They have aspirations. They have dreams. And they are willing to work hard. And if we give people the opportunity to actually meet those goals, they jump for it every time. But not everybody starts out from the same place in terms of having the opportunity to just get in there. And so my plans, whether it be $25,000 down payment assistance, whether it be a $6,000 child tax credit, or helping people in terms of what they need to do to be able to start a small business with a bigger tax deduction. The reason I'm saying all that is because when those folks are successful, we are all successful. The community feels it. And we actually strengthen the economy overall. When middle class is strong in America, America's economy is strong. It's a better country. And it's a better country for all of us. All right, so we're running short on time. We're gonna finish up with quick hitters. First thing to come to mind, let us know. Oh, cannabis? Your views on cannabis here. I just feel strongly people should not be going to jail for smoking weed.",chunk_17,367

Second, I just think we have come to a point where we have to understand that we need to legalize it and stop criminalizing this behavior. And so, and I've, actually, this is not a new position for me. I have felt for a long time we need to legalize it. So that's where I am on that. I love it. Okay. She said weed and not cannabis.

I mean, I feel that I know her because I have studied her life. You're walking in a footsteps. And yes, that a path that she created, right? It's a beautiful thing. One of my heroes is Thurgood Marshall. You know, and you talk about like him being active in the streets and what he did in terms of representation and then went to the court and carried that over.

What was your process and what did you do when you were deciding who to pick for your vice president? You know ultimately what it came down to was Tim Walls. If you look at Tim Walls and you look at me and you have a sense of who we are and where we came from, you think we have nothing in common. But his, you know, he comes from and grew up in the same kind of, you know, different part of the country. You know, folks were a different color from a different culture, but same people. Hardworking people, straight talking people. People who have values. And I just found that so familiar to me. And I guess that the process was ultimately I made a decision about my gut around like, do you, not that any of the other candidates didn't, but just do you, do you have a connection to the people and in a life experience that is about just seeing people and, but it was a whole thing.

Look, from the time that the president called me and told me he wasn't running, I mean, it just like everything was in speedy, speedy motion. And I was not sleeping so well.

Set your mind to your surroundings. Last question, as someone who's broke a ton of barriers throughout your journey and your journeys continuing to elevate, what does it mean to you to be the first woman president but the first black woman as president? Well, not there yet, not good. My mother had many sayings and one of them is she would say to me in Kamala, you may be the first to do many things, make sure you're not the last. And I take that so very seriously. I've had the good fortune to mentor a lot of people along the way, including to this day. For me, it's about one understanding the shoulders I stand on. We talk about a Shirley Chisholm and then so many people who are alive, who have mentored me and helped me up. And I just, I feel so strongly that, you know, each one pull one. You got to leave that door open more than it was when you walked in. And that's what it means to me. It's, I feel a great sense of responsibility. I mean, you talk about your daughter and what she's doing at school. I look at our sons, I look at, I mean, I feel a sense of responsibility to hopefully remind them that you should never hear no. You should never hear nobody like you has done this before or it's not your time or they're not ready. Like don't hear that. Don't hear that. I eat no for breakfast. That's my saying.

Right, well, because there's so many, it's sadly, but there's so much good in the world. So let's start with that. And there's so many positive messages. And there are some that are not positive. And that would suggest to our kids, to our young people that they're alone, that they don't have champions, that they don't belong, that they're not entitled to, that they don't have rights, including the right to be a leader.

2024-10-03,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Ripon, Wisconsin",full,"On a dairy farm. A true cheesehead. I am a lifelong Republican and in 2016 I voted for Donald Trump. Because he sounded like a tough guy who could get things done. Now looking back, I can't believe how wrong I was. As President Trump showed me over and over again, he does not have the values or the character to be in the White House. He didn't actually deliver on any of his promises. Except of course to cut taxes for his billionaire donors on the backs of working families. And then on January 6th, when I watched Trump try to overturn the election and encourage his supporters to violently storm the US Capitol. Ultimately resulting in the death of police officers, I was appalled and terrified. No member of law enforcement should be willing to stand next to him after all we witnessed on January 6th. And no one who cares about our Constitution should continue to stand by him after he has shown his disrespect for our democracy. It is now clear to me that Donald Trump is a danger to our country. That is why I am voting for Vice President Kamala Harris. When I was sheriff, it didn't matter whether you were a Republican, a Democrat, or anything in between. My job was to protect and serve my community. And I know Vice President Harris is the same kind of leader. As a former prosecutor, she has spent her entire career working to deliver safety, dignity, and justice to the people she serves. Today, as we gather in the very town where the Republican Party was founded I am asking my fellow Republicans to join me as we turn the page on Trump's campaign of division and chaos. Thank you so much. Now it is my honor to introduce a true patriot, someone who will always put her country over party. Congresswoman Liz Thank you. Wow. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. My God, what an amazing day to be in Wisconsin. Thank you all. Thank you so much. Thank you, Sheriff, for your courage and your service and for that wonderful introduction. It is such a pleasure to be here today at Ripon College. And I have to tell you all, Wisconsin is special for me for a particularly important reason. Way back in 1966, when a very young Dick Cheney and Lynn Cheney were graduate students at the University of Wisconsin, I was born here. And So, go Badgers, exactly. So, coming back to Wisconsin always feels to me more than a little bit like coming home. I want you to know the last time that I was here campaigning was 20 years ago, in 2004. And although politics divided us, certainly in that year, we were united in our admiration for the Packers legendary Bart Starr. And one of the most special and memorable days I had on any campaign was the day that we got to spend with him, which included a personal tour of Lambeau Field. So, very, very special to be back again. Now, you all know, of course, that here in Ripon, the Republican Party was founded. It was founded in a meeting in 1854 in the Little White Schoolhouse. And it was founded by people who were opposed to slavery. It was that Republican Party, the Party of Lincoln and Eisenhower, Party of Reagan and Bush. It's that party that I belonged to my entire life. I volunteered on my first presidential campaign. I already told you how old I am, so I'll tell you. In 1976, when I was 10 years old and I was sealing envelopes for President Ford's reelection campaign, I cast my first vote ever in 1984 for Ronald Reagan. I served in the State Department in both Bush administrations, and I served in the United States House of Representatives for three terms, including as the third highest ranking Republican in House leadership. So... In other words, I was a Republican even before Donald Trump started spray tanning. I am a Ronald Reagan conservative. I believe in limited government. I believe in low taxes. I believe in a strong national defense. And I believe that the private sector is the engine of growth of our economy. I believe that the family and not the government is the most important structure in our society. I know that our security and our freedom depend upon a world in which America, with our allies, leads. And above all else, I know that the most conservative of conservative values is fidelity to our Constitution. I tell you, I have never voted for a Democrat. But this year, I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. Thank you, Miss! Thank you, Miss! Thank you, Miss! Thank you, Miss! Thank you, Miss! Thank you, Miss! Thank you, Miss!

Thank you, Miss! Thank you, Miss! Thank you, Miss! Thank you, Miss! Thank you President Harris has dedicated her life to public service. I know that she loves our country and I know that she will be a president for all Americans. As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause. As we meet here today, our Republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before. A former President who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our Republic, by refusing to accept the lawful results confirmed by dozens of courts of the 2020 election. We cannot turn away from this truth. In this election, putting a vote on the President's election, we are not going to be able to turn away from the election. In this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration, it is our duty. At the very heart of our survival as a Republic is the peaceful transition of power. Ronald Reagan said this was nothing short of a miracle, that every four or eight years, the most powerful office in our land, indeed the most powerful office in the world, is passed peacefully to a new President. In the United States of America, violence does not and must never determine who rules us. Voters do. And in this country, under our Constitution, our President has a particular solemn obligation to ensure and guarantee the peaceful transfer of power. Since the beginning of the Republic, every President in our history has fulfilled that duty. Every President until Donald Trump. When Donald Trump woke up on the morning of January 6th, 2021, his intention, despite having lost the election, was that he would remain President. Rather than accept his loss and concede defeat, he had spent months overseeing a multi-part plan to attempt to seize power and remain in office. He ignored the rulings of the courts, he corruptly pressured state legislatures, including here in Wisconsin, to overturn the results of their elections. He told the Justice Department to lie for him. He conspired to have fake electoral votes cast, and he corruptly pressured his Vice President to take illegal and unconstitutional actions. He summoned a mob to Washington, D.C. with his lies, and he sent the armed mob to the United States Capitol in an effort to stop the counting of electoral votes. As the violent mob attacked our Capitol, in Donald Trump's name, as they brutally beat law enforcement officers, as they hunted the Vice President and the Speaker of the House, Donald Trump watched the attack on television for hours, for hours. Sitting in the dining room next to the Oval Office, he refused repeated pleas from his family, from his closest advisors, from the most senior officials in his campaign and in our government to tell the mob to leave. And when Donald Trump finally did speak, publicly, after hours of violence, after the Capitol had been invaded, he praised the rioters. He did not condemn them. That's who Donald Trump is. Those facts, those facts that we know about what Donald Trump did, including what he did when our Capitol was under siege, those facts do not come from Donald Trump's political opponents. Those facts come from the people closest to him. They are the ones who testified that Donald Trump did not want to stop the violent attack on our Capitol. When he learned that Vice President Pence was not going to abandon his oath and help Trump seize power, Trump sent out a tweet attacking Pence and further inflaming the mob. One of Trump's aides testified that shortly after that, this aide received a phone call alerting him that the Vice President had been evacuated for his own safety from his office off the floor of the Senate. This aide recalled rushing to the dining room to tell Trump, hoping that this information would convince him to take immediate action to ensure the Vice President's safety. Instead, after this aide delivered that news, Donald Trump looked up at him and said, so what? He said so what? Donald Trump's closest aide, who also told us this, said that while the attack on our Capitol was happening, Donald Trump was handed a note informing him that a civilian had been shot at the door to the chamber of the United States House of Representatives. Donald Trump put the note down on the table in front of him, continued to watch the attack on television, and still refused to tell the mob to leave the Capitol. Donald Trump was willing to sacrifice our Capitol to allow law enforcement officers to be beaten and brutalized in his name and to violate the law and the Constitution in order to seize power for himself. I don't care if you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent. That is depravity, and we must never become numb to it. Any person who would do these things can never be trusted with power again. We must defeat Donald Trump on November 5th. In that election 20 years ago when we were campaigning in Wisconsin and all across the country, we were campaigning as compassionate conservatives. What January 6th shows us is that there is not an ounce of compassion in Donald Trump. He is petty, he has been addictive, and he is cruel. And Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation. Now sometimes people will say, you know, January 6th wasn't that big a deal. You know, in a time when I have heard many pretty stunning things from Republicans, one of the most stunning was yesterday from your former governor, Scott Walker. Who said basically people are over January 6th. When you think about what that means, that an elected official, a former elected official is so willing to minimize what happened. To say things like I've heard from others, to say don't worry, our institutions held that day. We have a responsibility, all of us, to remind people that our institutions don't defend themselves. We the people have to do that. We the people defend our institutions. And our institutions held on January 6th because there were brave men and women, including elected officials at every level of our government, who did their duty, who stood up for what was right, who resisted Donald Trump's efforts to pressure them to violate their oaths. And our institutions held, especially because of the bravery of the men and women in law enforcement and in our military, in our Capitol Police, our Secret Service, the Metropolitan Police. They are the ones who defended our Capitol, our democracy, and our lives. Many of them fought a bloody, bloody, hours long battle on the west front of the Capitol. Go watch the video of that battle. It is sickening. They are the ones who held the line and prevented far worse from happening that day. They are the true profiles encouraged. Do not let anyone lie about what happened and what they did. Our institutions also held because of Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to violate his oath to the Constitution. And that is why Mike Pence is not Donald Trump's running mate today. Instead, JD Vance is on the ticket. Vance has said repeatedly that he would have done what Donald Trump wanted, that he would have rejected electoral votes. He would have thrown out the votes of the people of Wisconsin because he didn't like the way that you voted. That is tyranny and that is disqualifying. History teaches us again and again that democracies can fall. They fall to populists. They fall to strong men. Strong men who beguile their fellow citizens with conspiracy theories and false emergencies. As my friend the late Charles Krauthammer taught us, the lesson of our history is that the task of merely maintaining strong and sturdy the structures of our constitutional order is unending. It is the continuing and ceaseless work of every generation. And that responsibility now falls on all of us in this election. This great country of ours requires leaders of character. We must choose men and women who have what Abraham Lincoln called a sincere heart. Our nation's second president, John Adams, put it this way. On the first night he ever spent in the White House, he wrote a letter to his wife Abigail. And his letter included a prayer. A prayer that is so special, President Kennedy had it engraved in the mantelpiece in the state dining room in the White House. And in his letter he said this, may none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof. Now I'm confident, just a second, I am confident that John Adams meant women too. In this election, a broad coalition has come together to support Vice President Kamala Harris. Now we may disagree on some things, but we are bound together by the one thing that matters to us as Americans more than any other. And that's our duty to our Constitution and our belief in the miracle and the blessing of this incredible nation. We have a shared commitment as Americans to ensuring that future generations live in a nation where power is transferred peacefully. Where our leaders are men and women of good faith and where our public servants set aside partisan battles to do what's right for this country. So today I ask all of you here and everyone listening across this great country to join us. I ask you to meet this moment. I ask you to stand in truth, to reject the depraved cruelty of Donald Trump. And I ask you instead to help us elect Kamala Harris for President. I know, I know that President, that A. President Harris, that President Harris will be able to unite this nation. I know that she will be a President who will defend the rule of law. And I know that she will be a President who can inspire all of our children, and if I might say so, especially our little girls. To do great things. So help us write the ship of our democracy so that history will say of us when our time of testing came, we did our duty and we prevailed because we loved our country more.

Thank you Tammy Baldwin who is traveling around the state but who I know you will reelect in November. Thank you, Sheriff Mitchek for your support and your life of service to the people of Iowa County. And so I do want to say a bit more about Liz Cheney. You all know her leadership and she has obviously and so importantly been a leader for the people of Wyoming but she has also been an extraordinary national leader and has served with great honor. And she not only as she has talked today recognizes that character is among the most important attributes of leadership but she also personifies that attribute and she possesses some of the qualities of character that I most respect in any individual and any leader. Courage, especially at a moment like this where there are so many powerful forces that have been intent on trying to demean and belittle and make people afraid. And there are many who know it is wrong and then there are those who have the courage to speak out loudly about it and the conviction to speak truth. And you know it is so admirable when anyone does it and especially when it is difficult to do in an environment such as this. But Liz Cheney really is a leader who puts country above party and above self a true patriot and it is my profound honor, my profound honor to have your support. And I also want to thank your father, vice president Dick Cheney for his support and what he has done to serve our country. Every endorsement matters and this endorsement matters a great deal Liz and it carries the special significance because as you said we may not see eye to eye on every issue and we are going to get back to a healthy two-party system. I am sure of that where we will have vigorous debates. And as you said you may not have supported a Democrat for president before but as you have also said we both love our country and we revere our democratic ideals and we both also believe in the nobility of public service and we know that our oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America is a sacred oath. An oath that must be honored and must never be violated. And your words today and the reason we are all here today I think really do underscore perhaps one of the most fundamental questions that is facing the American people in this election. Who will obey that oath? Who will abide by the oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America. I have had the privilege. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution six times in my career including as vice president, as a United States senator and as the top law enforcement officer of the largest state in our country. Responsible for upholding and enforcing the laws of the state and the laws of the United States was the work I did. And I have never wavered in upholding that oath and I have always executed it faithfully and without reservation. And therein lies the profound difference between Donald Trump and me. He who violated the oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America and make no mistake he who if given the chance would violate it again. Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. And as you have heard and know he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of an election that was free and fair. As you have heard he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol where they assaulted law enforcement officers. He threatened the life of his own vice president and refused to engage in the peaceful transfer of power. And let us be clear about how he intends to use power if elected again. He has called for jailing journalists, political opponents, anyone he sees and deems as being an enemy. He has pledged to destroy the independence of the Department of Justice and he called for deploying our active duty military against our own citizens. Well I believe you and my running mate both. Well listen I believe that anyone who recklessly tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has anyone who has actively and violently obstructed the will of the people and the peaceful transfer of power as Donald Trump has anyone who has called for I quote termination of the Constitution of the United States as Donald Trump has must never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States never again never again and the tragic truth the tragic truth that we are facing in this election for president of the United States is that there is actually an honest question about whether one of the candidates will uphold the oath to the Constitution of the United States that is the tragic truth of this election that this is actually an honest question that we are having as Americans and I know the vast majority of us agree that upholding the Constitution must be a basic requirement we expect of anyone seeking the highest office in the land I know the vast majority of us regardless of your political party agree we must hold sacred America's fundamental principles from the rule of law to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power and if you share if you share that view no matter your political party there is a place for you with us and in this campaign because those principles I know unite us across party lines and in this election I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans my entire career my entire career I've only had one client the people and when I say that and when I say that I mean all the people not just those who share my party affiliation through all my decades in law enforcement I never asked a victim or witness are you a Republican or a Democrat the only question I ever asked was are you okay and that is the kind of president we deserve and I pledge to you that is the kind of president I will be because the president of the United States must not look at our country through the narrow lens of ideology or petty partisanship or self-interest the president of the United States must not look at our country as an instrument for their own ambitions our nation is not some spoil to be won the United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised the nation that inspired the world to believe in the possibilities of a representative government and so in the face of those who would endanger our magnificent experiment people of every party must stand together and let me be clear democracy and freedom are not only at stake here at home they are also at stake around the world as president of the United States I will strengthen not abdicate America's global leadership last week I met with Ukraine's president Zelensky and the message I delivered was the same message I've shared with him every time I've seen him I stand with Ukraine and I always will and I told him as I have before I want Ukraine to prevail by contrast in our debate Donald Trump couldn't even bring himself to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war couldn't even bring himself to say that a war that Putin a brutal dictator launched against a free and independent people Trump wants to force Ukraine to give up its sovereign territory a bedrock principle upon which we stand and fight for and you know who else wants them to give up their sovereign absolutely territory Putin and that's not a plan for peace it's a plan for surrender well I believe that in the global struggle between tyranny and democracy the president of the United States must always be on the side of freedom so we are gathered here today in Rippon not far as the congresswoman mentioned from a small building where the Republican Party was born in 1854 Liz Cheney stands in the finest tradition of its leaders and if and if people across Wisconsin and our nation are willing to do what Liz is doing to stand up for the rule of law for our democratic ideals and the Constitution of the United States then together I know we can chart a new way forward not as members of any one party but as Americans Americans who are united united in our devotion to the country we love I thank you all may God bless you and may God bless the United States of America thank you oh oh oh oh yeah oh oh oh oh I knew something was wrong my head was just pounding come to find out I've got a brain tumor the size of a grapefruit it was a hundred and eighty seven thousand dollars to get this taken out back then most farmers couldn't afford health insurance when the tumor came back the affordable care act saved my life and my farm Trump is coming for our health care that's pretty damn scary Kamala Harris cares about us she fought for us to get health care and she's fighting for us to keep it I'm Kamala Harris and I approve this message you",full,4973
2024-10-03,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Ripon, Wisconsin",chunk,"On a dairy farm. A true cheesehead. I am a lifelong Republican and in 2016 I voted for Donald Trump. Because he sounded like a tough guy who could get things done. Now looking back, I can't believe how wrong I was. As President Trump showed me over and over again, he does not have the values or the character to be in the White House. He didn't actually deliver on any of his promises. Except of course to cut taxes for his billionaire donors on the backs of working families. And then on January 6th, when I watched Trump try to overturn the election and encourage his supporters to violently storm the US Capitol. Ultimately resulting in the death of police officers, I was appalled and terrified. No member of law enforcement should be willing to stand next to him after all we witnessed on January 6th. And no one who cares about our Constitution should continue to stand by him after he has shown his disrespect for our democracy. It is now clear to me that Donald Trump is a danger to our country. That is why I am voting for Vice President Kamala Harris. When I was sheriff, it didn't matter whether you were a Republican, a Democrat, or anything in between. My job was to protect and serve my community. And I know Vice President Harris is the same kind of leader. As a former prosecutor, she has spent her entire career working to deliver safety, dignity, and justice to the people she serves. Today, as we gather in the very town where the Republican Party was founded I am asking my fellow Republicans to join me as we turn the page on Trump's campaign of division and chaos. Thank you so much. Now it is my honor to introduce a true patriot, someone who will always put her country over party. Congresswoman Liz Thank you. Wow. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. My God, what an amazing day to be in Wisconsin. Thank you all. Thank you so much. Thank you, Sheriff, for your courage and your service and for that wonderful introduction.",chunk_1,375
2024-10-03,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Ripon, Wisconsin",chunk,"It is such a pleasure to be here today at Ripon College. And I have to tell you all, Wisconsin is special for me for a particularly important reason. Way back in 1966, when a very young Dick Cheney and Lynn Cheney were graduate students at the University of Wisconsin, I was born here. And So, go Badgers, exactly. So, coming back to Wisconsin always feels to me more than a little bit like coming home. I want you to know the last time that I was here campaigning was 20 years ago, in 2004. And although politics divided us, certainly in that year, we were united in our admiration for the Packers legendary Bart Starr. And one of the most special and memorable days I had on any campaign was the day that we got to spend with him, which included a personal tour of Lambeau Field. So, very, very special to be back again. Now, you all know, of course, that here in Ripon, the Republican Party was founded. It was founded in a meeting in 1854 in the Little White Schoolhouse. And it was founded by people who were opposed to slavery. It was that Republican Party, the Party of Lincoln and Eisenhower, Party of Reagan and Bush. It's that party that I belonged to my entire life. I volunteered on my first presidential campaign. I already told you how old I am, so I'll tell you. In 1976, when I was 10 years old and I was sealing envelopes for President Ford's reelection campaign, I cast my first vote ever in 1984 for Ronald Reagan. I served in the State Department in both Bush administrations, and I served in the United States House of Representatives for three terms, including as the third highest ranking Republican in House leadership. So.. In other words, I was a Republican even before Donald Trump started spray tanning. I am a Ronald Reagan conservative. I believe in limited government. I believe in low taxes. I believe in a strong national defense. And I believe that the private sector is the engine of growth of our economy. I believe that the family and not the government is the most important structure in our society.",chunk_2,372

2024-10-03,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Ripon, Wisconsin",chunk,"As we meet here today, our Republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before. A former President who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our Republic, by refusing to accept the lawful results confirmed by dozens of courts of the 2020 election. We cannot turn away from this truth. In this election, putting a vote on the President's election, we are not going to be able to turn away from the election. In this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration, it is our duty. At the very heart of our survival as a Republic is the peaceful transition of power. Ronald Reagan said this was nothing short of a miracle, that every four or eight years, the most powerful office in our land, indeed the most powerful office in the world, is passed peacefully to a new President. In the United States of America, violence does not and must never determine who rules us. Voters do. And in this country, under our Constitution, our President has a particular solemn obligation to ensure and guarantee the peaceful transfer of power. Since the beginning of the Republic, every President in our history has fulfilled that duty. Every President until Donald Trump. When Donald Trump woke up on the morning of January 6th, 2021, his intention, despite having lost the election, was that he would remain President. Rather than accept his loss and concede defeat, he had spent months overseeing a multi-part plan to attempt to seize power and remain in office. He ignored the rulings of the courts, he corruptly pressured state legislatures, including here in Wisconsin, to overturn the results of their elections. He told the Justice Department to lie for him. He conspired to have fake electoral votes cast, and he corruptly pressured his Vice President to take illegal and unconstitutional actions. He summoned a mob to Washington, D.C. with his lies, and he sent the armed mob to the United States Capitol in an effort to stop the counting of electoral votes. As the violent mob attacked our Capitol, in Donald Trump's name, as they brutally beat law enforcement officers, as they hunted the Vice President and the Speaker of the House, Donald Trump watched the attack on television for hours, for hours.",chunk_4,384
2024-10-03,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Ripon, Wisconsin",chunk,"Sitting in the dining room next to the Oval Office, he refused repeated pleas from his family, from his closest advisors, from the most senior officials in his campaign and in our government to tell the mob to leave. And when Donald Trump finally did speak, publicly, after hours of violence, after the Capitol had been invaded, he praised the rioters. He did not condemn them. That's who Donald Trump is. Those facts, those facts that we know about what Donald Trump did, including what he did when our Capitol was under siege, those facts do not come from Donald Trump's political opponents. Those facts come from the people closest to him. They are the ones who testified that Donald Trump did not want to stop the violent attack on our Capitol. When he learned that Vice President Pence was not going to abandon his oath and help Trump seize power, Trump sent out a tweet attacking Pence and further inflaming the mob. One of Trump's aides testified that shortly after that, this aide received a phone call alerting him that the Vice President had been evacuated for his own safety from his office off the floor of the Senate. This aide recalled rushing to the dining room to tell Trump, hoping that this information would convince him to take immediate action to ensure the Vice President's safety. Instead, after this aide delivered that news, Donald Trump looked up at him and said, so what? He said so what? Donald Trump's closest aide, who also told us this, said that while the attack on our Capitol was happening, Donald Trump was handed a note informing him that a civilian had been shot at the door to the chamber of the United States House of Representatives. Donald Trump put the note down on the table in front of him, continued to watch the attack on television, and still refused to tell the mob to leave the Capitol. Donald Trump was willing to sacrifice our Capitol to allow law enforcement officers to be beaten and brutalized in his name and to violate the law and the Constitution in order to seize power for himself.",chunk_5,362
2024-10-03,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Ripon, Wisconsin",chunk,"I don't care if you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent. That is depravity, and we must never become numb to it. Any person who would do these things can never be trusted with power again. We must defeat Donald Trump on November 5th. In that election 20 years ago when we were campaigning in Wisconsin and all across the country, we were campaigning as compassionate conservatives. What January 6th shows us is that there is not an ounce of compassion in Donald Trump. He is petty, he has been addictive, and he is cruel. And Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation. Now sometimes people will say, you know, January 6th wasn't that big a deal. You know, in a time when I have heard many pretty stunning things from Republicans, one of the most stunning was yesterday from your former governor, Scott Walker. Who said basically people are over January 6th. When you think about what that means, that an elected official, a former elected official is so willing to minimize what happened. To say things like I've heard from others, to say don't worry, our institutions held that day. We have a responsibility, all of us, to remind people that our institutions don't defend themselves. We the people have to do that. We the people defend our institutions. And our institutions held on January 6th because there were brave men and women, including elected officials at every level of our government, who did their duty, who stood up for what was right, who resisted Donald Trump's efforts to pressure them to violate their oaths. And our institutions held, especially because of the bravery of the men and women in law enforcement and in our military, in our Capitol Police, our Secret Service, the Metropolitan Police. They are the ones who defended our Capitol, our democracy, and our lives. Many of them fought a bloody, bloody, hours long battle on the west front of the Capitol. Go watch the video of that battle. It is sickening. They are the ones who held the line and prevented far worse from happening that day.",chunk_6,362
2024-10-03,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Ripon, Wisconsin",chunk,"They are the true profiles encouraged. Do not let anyone lie about what happened and what they did. Our institutions also held because of Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to violate his oath to the Constitution. And that is why Mike Pence is not Donald Trump's running mate today. Instead, JD Vance is on the ticket. Vance has said repeatedly that he would have done what Donald Trump wanted, that he would have rejected electoral votes. He would have thrown out the votes of the people of Wisconsin because he didn't like the way that you voted. That is tyranny and that is disqualifying. History teaches us again and again that democracies can fall. They fall to populists. They fall to strong men. Strong men who beguile their fellow citizens with conspiracy theories and false emergencies. As my friend the late Charles Krauthammer taught us, the lesson of our history is that the task of merely maintaining strong and sturdy the structures of our constitutional order is unending. It is the continuing and ceaseless work of every generation. And that responsibility now falls on all of us in this election. This great country of ours requires leaders of character. We must choose men and women who have what Abraham Lincoln called a sincere heart. Our nation's second president, John Adams, put it this way. On the first night he ever spent in the White House, he wrote a letter to his wife Abigail. And his letter included a prayer. A prayer that is so special, President Kennedy had it engraved in the mantelpiece in the state dining room in the White House. And in his letter he said this, may none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof. Now I'm confident, just a second, I am confident that John Adams meant women too. In this election, a broad coalition has come together to support Vice President Kamala Harris. Now we may disagree on some things, but we are bound together by the one thing that matters to us as Americans more than any other. And that's our duty to our Constitution and our belief in the miracle and the blessing of this incredible nation.",chunk_7,368
2024-10-03,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Ripon, Wisconsin",chunk,"We have a shared commitment as Americans to ensuring that future generations live in a nation where power is transferred peacefully. Where our leaders are men and women of good faith and where our public servants set aside partisan battles to do what's right for this country. So today I ask all of you here and everyone listening across this great country to join us. I ask you to meet this moment. I ask you to stand in truth, to reject the depraved cruelty of Donald Trump. And I ask you instead to help us elect Kamala Harris for President. I know, I know that President, that A. President Harris, that President Harris will be able to unite this nation. I know that she will be a President who will defend the rule of law. And I know that she will be a President who can inspire all of our children, and if I might say so, especially our little girls. To do great things. So help us write the ship of our democracy so that history will say of us when our time of testing came, we did our duty and we prevailed because we loved our country more.

Responsible for upholding and enforcing the laws of the state and the laws of the United States was the work I did.",chunk_10,395
2024-10-03,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Ripon, Wisconsin",chunk,"And I have never wavered in upholding that oath and I have always executed it faithfully and without reservation. And therein lies the profound difference between Donald Trump and me. He who violated the oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America and make no mistake he who if given the chance would violate it again. Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. And as you have heard and know he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of an election that was free and fair. As you have heard he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol where they assaulted law enforcement officers. He threatened the life of his own vice president and refused to engage in the peaceful transfer of power. And let us be clear about how he intends to use power if elected again. He has called for jailing journalists, political opponents, anyone he sees and deems as being an enemy. He has pledged to destroy the independence of the Department of Justice and he called for deploying our active duty military against our own citizens. Well I believe you and my running mate both.",chunk_11,197
2024-10-03,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Ripon, Wisconsin",chunk,Well listen I believe that anyone who recklessly tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has anyone who has actively and violently obstructed the will of the people and the peaceful transfer of power as Donald Trump has anyone who has called for I quote termination of the Constitution of the United States as Donald Trump has must never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States never again never again and the tragic truth the tragic truth that we are facing in this election for president of the United States is that there is actually an honest question about whether one of the candidates will uphold the oath to the Constitution of the United States that is the tragic truth of this election that this is actually an honest question that we are having as Americans and I know the vast majority of us agree that upholding the Constitution must be a basic requirement we expect of anyone seeking the highest office in the land I know the vast majority of us regardless of your political party agree we must hold sacred America's fundamental principles from the rule of law to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power and if you share if you share that view no matter your political party there is a place for you with us and in this campaign because those principles I know unite us across party lines and in this election I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans my entire career my entire career I've only had one client the people and when I say that and when I say that I mean all the people not just those who share my party affiliation through all my decades in law enforcement I never asked a victim or witness are you a Republican or a Democrat the only question I ever asked was are you okay and that is the kind of president we deserve and I pledge to you that is the kind of president I will be because the president of the United States must not look at our country through the narrow lens of ideology or petty partisanship or self-interest the president of the United States must not look at our country as an instrument for their own ambitions our nation is not some spoil to be won the United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised the nation that inspired the world to believe in the possibilities of a representative government and so in the face of those who would endanger our magnificent experiment people of every party must stand together and let me be clear democracy and freedom are not only at stake here at home they are also at stake around the world as president of the United States I will strengthen not abdicate America's global leadership last week I met with Ukraine's president Zelensky and the message I delivered was the same message I've shared with him every time I've seen him I stand with Ukraine and I always will and I told him as I have before I want Ukraine to prevail by contrast in our debate Donald Trump couldn't even bring himself to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war couldn't even bring himself to say that a war that Putin a brutal dictator launched against a free and independent people Trump wants to force Ukraine to give up its sovereign territory a bedrock principle upon which we stand and fight for and you know who else wants them to give up their sovereign absolutely territory Putin and that's not a plan for peace it's a plan for surrender well I believe that in the global struggle between tyranny and democracy the president of the United States must always be on the side of freedom so we are gathered here today in Rippon not far as the congresswoman mentioned from a small building where the Republican Party was born in 1854 Liz Cheney stands in the finest tradition of its leaders and if and if people across Wisconsin and our nation are willing to do what Liz is doing to stand up for the rule of law for our democratic ideals and the Constitution of the United States then together I know we can chart a new way forward not as members of any one party but as Americans Americans who are united united in our devotion to the country we love I thank you all may God bless you and may God bless the United States of America thank you oh oh oh oh yeah oh oh oh oh I knew something was wrong my head was just pounding come to find out I've got a brain tumor the size of a grapefruit it was a hundred and eighty seven thousand dollars to get this taken out back then most farmers couldn't afford health insurance when the tumor came back the affordable care act saved my life and my farm Trump is coming for our health care that's pretty damn scary Kamala Harris cares about us she fought for us to get health care and she's fighting for us to keep it I'm Kamala Harris and I approve this message you.,chunk_12,885
2024-10-04,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Flint, Michigan",full,"We want to present these buffs to our governor, Big Grinch. Throw them buffs on her face, because that's Big Grinch. We ain't even about the stress. We got Big Grinch. You can find her in the print. Under Big Grinch. Fresh in a new dress. Yeah, that's Big Grinch. Throw the buffs on her face, because that's Big Grinch. We ain't even about the stress. We got Big Grinch. You can find her in the print. All right. Hello, Flint. Hello, Flint. Whoo! Hello, Flint. Who's fired up to welcome our next president, Kamala Harris? Now, you know, I can't be in Flint without recognizing Congressman Dan Kildee. I'm going to give it up for him. And our next congressperson, Kristen McDonald Rivet. Let's hear it for her. So, in my few minutes with you today, I want to talk about an issue that is top of mind for Michiganders everywhere in every election. Jobs, jobs, and... Right. Everyone of us wants and deserves a job that will help us pay the bills, put food on the table, and help us get a secure retirement. The promise of a path to prosperity drew hundreds of thousands of people from all around the world to places like Flint, Michigan. And I love you too. In its heyday, Flint, Michigan was the second biggest city in our state with 80,000 union auto workers. Over decades, though, we know that Flint was left behind. And when Donald Trump ran for office, he said a lot of things. He said he would save all the jobs and bring back American manufacturing. But Donald Trump was all talk. As president, Trump oversaw an American manufacturing recession. By the time he left office, Michigan had lost more than 280,000 jobs. Now, maybe to a guy like Trump, he doesn't understand 280,000 jobs lost is 280,000 households that struggle to get by. Donald Trump's record on auto jobs, on manufacturing, and on putting American workers first is failure, failure, failure. He said not one auto plant would close. The truth five closed. He said he'd support unions. The truth, he made it harder to bargain for better pay and benefits. This guy who claims to be a friend of workers even suggested that manufacturing move out of Michigan and to anti-union states in the south. If he is given a second term, he will enact huge tariffs. He will enact essentially, we're not going back. That's right. We're not going back. Donald Trump's tariffs are essentially the same as a tax, a national sales tax that will cost every one of you thousands of dollars a year. And just this week, his running mate, JD Vance, that guy from Ohio, JD Vance said they do not support $500 million federal investment to upgrade our auto plants. You cannot tell me you care about the people of Michigan if you're going to undermine the core of our economy in Michigan. So it's pretty simple. When you have a chance to save hundreds of good paying Michigan auto jobs and create more, you take it. Instead, the Trump Vance ticket is giving the middle finger to workers here in Michigan. It was the Biden Harris administration that took action to save union jobs. Donald Trump must think that Michiganders aren't very smart. Well, boy, do we have news for him, right? Because you can't go to Texas and love Elon Musk's EVs and then come here and denigrate EVs and the jobs that come along with him. I'm so tired of that guy saying one thing to people in a different state and coming here and saying another thing to Michiganders. We are not stupid. We know who stands up for us. We know the pain that when a factory leaves, it takes a whole lot with it. It means fewer kids in our local public schools. It means fewer first responders on the street and fewer local small businesses. No place in America knows this better than Flint, Michigan. When Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office, things finally started changing. Today, there are more auto workers than when Trump was president. There are more factories getting built three times as many as when Donald Trump was president. And the list goes on. More construction workers. More of those damn roads getting fixed. I never knew people would cheer so loud for roads. My God, I love it. More lead pipes being replaced. More middle class jobs. More on all of these fronts than when Donald Trump was president. We are headed in the right direction and we're not going back. We are headed in the right direction and we're not going back. We are headed in the right direction and we're not going back. We are headed in the right direction and we're not going back. We are headed in the right direction and we're not going back. We are headed in the right direction and we're not going back. Clean energy project to everywhere in 124,000 jobs too. And hometown company here General Motors is investing a billion dollars in Flint assembly and Flint metal center to build heavy duty. That former president is the one who's railing against the Michigan economy and let me tell you we are building heavy duty gas powered trucks here. Let's go. So as president Kamala Harris knows that when we make more here in America, whether it's more energy, more cars, more batteries, more chips, we are stronger and the middle class grows. These chips are so important. They go in everything from your phone to your car to your dishwasher to your computer and everything else. And while Donald Trump worked against the chips act, Kamala Harris and Democrats got it over the finish line. And it's working. Chip factories are popping up all across America. We have proven that you can bring jobs back home and reduce our alliance on Chinese chips. But we need a leader who's willing to actually do the work. In his four years as president, Trump took us backwards. Kamala Harris has overseen a manufacturing boom. Thanks to her leadership. Yeah. Thanks to her leadership. We are growing the middle class and our economy is growing too. So this November, we have a very clear choice, a coordinated strategy to bring back manufacturing and glow grow the middle class, or the same old guy with the same old ideas about outsourcing and anti union leadership. So, Big Rich says let's vote for Kamala Harris. Let's win this thing. Thank you. Thank you. It's almost that time. Hey, rocket to the beat. Hey, y'all look sweet. I just got that word. Hey, you a boo. Ready to beat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Clint, how you doing today? Wow. It's so great to be back home. And what an outstanding cause to elect my friend Kamala Harris, President of the United States. I'm here because I've known Kamala for over 20 years. Cookie and I supported her run for Attorney General back in the state of California, her run for Senator. And now we support her as the VP, but now the biggest moment for all of us. November the 5th, we have to do all we can to elect Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States. She wants to build up the middle class and I know something about the middle class because I come from a middle class family. My father worked 30 years for Fisher body. When I turned pro, I thought that was going to be the greatest moment in my father's life, but it wasn't. The greatest moment in his life came when he finally owns his own home. What does Kamala Harris wants to do as President, put millions of Americans in their own home, give them $25,000 to start them off to be homeowners. That's very important. Then she wants to also have more small business owners and she's going to help them out by giving them $50,000 for start up new small business owners. Tax deduction. She's smart. She's strong. She's passionate. Nobody's going to out work her. She's committed to you as the people of the United States, the people of Michigan. She's committed to you. She's going to be a President for everybody. One thing she's going to do is finally unite us, bring us together. That other party is trying to tear us down. I say this because I'm back home. First of all, let me congratulate your Tigers. I grew up a Tiger fan. So I'm hoping that your Tigers meet my dodgers for the World Series. But we have 32 days. That sound familiar? Somebody wore number 32. You know who that is. Until November 5th. Now, we can't take anything for granted. You've been working hard, but we need to work harder. We've got to call people. We've got to knock on doors after and before church. Not during church, but after and before church. We've got to rally people, talk to them. Now, there's a lot of black men in here. And I don't mean to, you know, not talk to other people, but this is important. Our black men, we've got to get them out to vote. That's number one. Kamala's opponent promised a lot of things last time to the black community that he did not deliver on. And we've got to make sure we help black men understand that. So that's why I'm here to make sure I help black men understand. First, get out and vote, and then vote for the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. She's for women's rights to make their own decision with their body. We've got to clap for them. Now, I'm about to bring her out because you came to hear her. You had some great speakers here. I see the UAW president. I was really blown away because... Not only did my father work there, my brother Larry, my brother Michael, his wife Ronnie, I got now nieces and nephews who belong to the union. So thank you for what you're doing. She's always been for labor and union. Kamala Harris has always been for labor and union. That's never going to change. Now, this is the year for women. We just... Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. We just saw what Mexico did. Elected his first woman president ever. So you know where I'm going with this. Let's make sure we here in the United States elect our first woman president in Kamala Harris. Thank you, Michigan, for allowing me to come home. I always loved coming home. But the main thing here is we got to do a lot of work before November the 5th to elect Kamala Harris as our next president of the United States. So please, we're going to be motivated when you leave here, but let's go to work. When we fight, when we vote, God bless you. Thank you. You can feel it all over people. You can feel it all over. You can feel it all over people. You can feel it all over. Yeah, yeah. You can feel it all over. You can feel it all over people. You can feel it all over. You can feel it all over people.

I'm fighting for a candidate who will protect our freedoms and our democracy. So with that, ladies and gentlemen, it is my great honor to introduce to you our next president, Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. Good evening, Michigan! Hey! Oh, it's good to be back in Michigan! Hey, everyone! Can we hear it for Eric Price? Oh, it's good to be back in Michigan! Thank you! Thank you! Oh, it's good to be back in Michigan! Thank you all so very much! Thank you so very much! And Eric Price, thank you for your leadership of UAW 651! And all the work that you do!

Thank you to all the people who are here today. Thank you to all the people who are here today. Thank you to all the people who are here today. And this is going to be a very tight race until the very end. This is going to be a very tight race until the very end. We are the underdog and we know we have some hard work ahead. But here's the thing about us, we like hard work! We like hard work! Hard work is good work! Hard work is good work! And with your help in November, we will win. We will win. We are not playing around. So listen, we know this election is about two very different visions for our nation. One focused on the past and ours which is focused on the future. We are fighting for a future where we tap into the ambitions and the aspirations of the American people and build what I call an opportunity economy so every American has an opportunity to own a home, build wealth, start a business. And I might speak about small business owners in the house right here. Right? Okay, so on the economy, I'm just going to spend a minute on small businesses. Because let me tell you, growing up, our mother often worked very long hours. And so my sister Maya and I, we would go over to Micheltan's house. Micheltan was from Louisiana and we called her our second mother. And Micheltan was a small business owner. And so from being a child, I know who our small business owners are. They are community leaders, civic leaders, they mentor, they hire locally, they build up the community, they are part of the fabric of the community. And small business owners are the backbone of America's economy. So in my plan to build an opportunity economy, one of the things I will do is raise the startup deduction from $5,000 to $50,000 to help entrepreneurs start their small business. You heard Eric talk about it, we need to build more housing in America. You know, my mother saved up for years to buy our first homes. I was a teenager by the time she saved up enough to do that. And right now we know there's a serious housing shortage in our country and it is part of what is driving up costs. So we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes and provide first-time home buyers with a $25,000 down payment assistance. So you can just literally get your foot in the door and you'll handle the rest. We need to lower the cost of living. Look, our economy is making good progress. Just this morning we got a solid jobs report, right? Over 250,000 jobs created last month, unemployment fell, and just a few weeks ago the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, which helps. But there's still more we need to do. Prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. And I have a plan on lowering costs on everything from healthcare to groceries including taking on corporate price gouging. Because as Attorney General, I saw what happens where there are a few of them, not everybody, but those who take advantage of desperate people, in particular in the middle of an emergency, and there needs to be consequence. I will give a tax cut to 100 million Americans including $6,000 extending and expanding the child tax credit. So during the first year of a child's life, young parents have the support they need to be able to buy a car seat, to buy a crib, to take care of their child during that first year of their life, knowing it's about setting them on a path to do everything they have a natural desire to do. And look, I say all this to say, I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class and I will never forget where I come from. I will never forget where I come from. And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing. So over the last three and a half years, we have brought manufacturing back to America creating 730,000 manufacturing jobs. We announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States. And we did it by investing in American industry and American workers. And I will make sure that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century, which is why under my plan we will invest in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, and the great American auto industry. I see you, Sean. And we will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs from advanced batteries to electric vehicles are not only invented but built right here in America by American union workers. And Michigan, let us be clear, contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive. But here's what I will do. I will invest in communities like Flint. Flint, which helped build the auto industry and the UAW. We will retool existing factories higher locally and work with unions to create good paying jobs, including jobs that do not require a college degree. Because we understand a college degree is not the only measure of whether a worker has skills and experience to get the job done. In fact, part of my plan is to outline all of the federal jobs that should not require a college degree and make that clear, and when I'm elected, I'm going to challenge the private sector to take on the same approach. And then there's Donald Trump. So Donald Trump has a very different approach. So Donald Trump makes big promises, and he always fails to deliver. He said he was the only one who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs. Remember that? And then America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president. Including tens of thousands of jobs in Michigan. And those losses started before the pandemic, making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history. And his track record for the auto industry was a disaster. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, I'll quote, not lose one plant during his presidency. And then American auto makers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president. We need a medic over here. We need a medic over here. Right here. Okay, can everyone part so that medic can come through please? Let's let the medic through. Okay. Okay. He's okay. All right. We're good. We got each other. Good. Good. Good. Good. So remembering again what Donald Trump talked about versus what he did. And then American auto makers announced the closure of six plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stalantis in Detroit. Thousands of Michigan auto workers lost their jobs. And when it came to building the cars of the future, Donald Trump sat on the sidelines and let China dominate. And then he talks down to American workers saying we can't compete with Chinese workers. And make no mistake, Donald Trump is no friend of labor. He encouraged automakers to move their plants out of Michigan so they could pay their workers less. And when the UAW went on strike to demand higher wages that they deserved, Donald Trump went to a non-union shop. Don't forget. And he attacked the UAW. And he said striking and collective bargaining don't make quote a damn bit of difference. Remember how he's talked about striking workers that you should fire them. That's how he talks about union labor. That's how he talks about workers. But Flint, we know, we know strong unions mean higher wages, better healthcare, and greater dignity. For union members and for everyone. And on top of all of that, Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion tax cut that mostly went to the wealthy and big corporations, not to working people. And now he is making the same empty promises to the people of Michigan that he did before. But we will not be fooled. We will not be gaslighted. Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people. And if he wins again, it will be more of the same. Check this out. Two days ago, his running mate, maybe you saw that. No, but... How about that Tim Walls, by the way? So two days ago, Donald Trump's running mate suggested that if Trump wins, he might let the Grand River Assembly plant in Lansing close down. The same plant that our administration helped save earlier this year along with 650 union jobs. Michigan, we together fought hard for those jobs. And you deserve a president who won't put them at risk. And for anybody watching, you know, if you want to learn more about Donald Trump's plans, just Google Project 2025. It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts, attack unions, cut social security and Medicare, and impose a Trump sales tax, a 20% tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average family nearly $4,000 a year. And on top of all this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. Even after he tried to repeal it time and time again when he was president, and still has no plan to replace it. You watched the debate. You watched the debate. You saw that. He said, he said he quote, has concepts of a plan. Concepts. You know, you know, I have said that I do believe he is an unserious man. And the consequences and the consequences of him being president again are absolutely critically serious. Because think about it, even on healthcare, he has a concept of a plan. So he is going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million people in our country based on a concept. To take us back, you remember that? When insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. Remember what that was like? Well, Michigan, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. No. Because we will move forward. Ours is a fight for the future. Ours is a fight for the future. And ours is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And these 32 days out from the election, it is important that we remind people how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overturn Roe v. Wade. And they did. And now more than one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. And here's what I want to say. And that's not our only battle. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard fought, hard fought, won freedoms and rights. Like the freedom to vote. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to join a union. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. And the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water. Flint, you know all too well, Flint, that clean water should be a right for everyone, not just for the people who can afford it. And as President, I will continue to work with communities like Flint to ensure you not only have clean water, but the opportunity to recover economically and thrive. So Michigan, it all comes down to this. We are all here together because we know what is at stake. And we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. We love our country. And because we love our country, we know it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what this is about. That's what this is about. So election day is in 32 days. And already nearly 2 million ballots are in the hands of Michigan voters alone. So if you have received your ballot, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today. Early voting starts statewide on October 26. And now is the time to make your plan to vote. Because folks, the election is here. The election is here. And we need to make sure that we have the right to vote. And we need to energize, organize, and mobilize. And remember, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. So Flint, today I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. I'm ready to make my own decisions. I'm ready to make my own decisions. I'm ready to make my own decisions. I'm ready to make my own decisions. I'm ready to make my own decisions. I'm ready to make my own decisions.

We ain't even about the stress. We got Big Grinch. You can find her in the print. Under Big Grinch. Fresh in a new dress. Yeah, that's Big Grinch. Throw the buffs on her face, because that's Big Grinch. We ain't even about the stress. We got Big Grinch. You can find her in the print. All right. Hello, Flint. Hello, Flint. Whoo! Hello, Flint. Who's fired up to welcome our next president, Kamala Harris? Now, you know, I can't be in Flint without recognizing Congressman Dan Kildee. I'm going to give it up for him. And our next congressperson, Kristen McDonald Rivet. Let's hear it for her. So, in my few minutes with you today, I want to talk about an issue that is top of mind for Michiganders everywhere in every election. Jobs, jobs, and.. Right. Everyone of us wants and deserves a job that will help us pay the bills, put food on the table, and help us get a secure retirement. The promise of a path to prosperity drew hundreds of thousands of people from all around the world to places like Flint, Michigan. And I love you too. In its heyday, Flint, Michigan was the second biggest city in our state with 80,000 union auto workers. Over decades, though, we know that Flint was left behind. And when Donald Trump ran for office, he said a lot of things. He said he would save all the jobs and bring back American manufacturing. But Donald Trump was all talk. As president, Trump oversaw an American manufacturing recession. By the time he left office, Michigan had lost more than 280,000 jobs. Now, maybe to a guy like Trump, he doesn't understand 280,000 jobs lost is 280,000 households that struggle to get by. Donald Trump's record on auto jobs, on manufacturing, and on putting American workers first is failure, failure, failure. He said not one auto plant would close. The truth five closed. He said he'd support unions. The truth, he made it harder to bargain for better pay and benefits. This guy who claims to be a friend of workers even suggested that manufacturing move out of Michigan and to anti-union states in the south.",chunk_1,389
2024-10-04,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Flint, Michigan",chunk,"If he is given a second term, he will enact huge tariffs. He will enact essentially, we're not going back. That's right. We're not going back. Donald Trump's tariffs are essentially the same as a tax, a national sales tax that will cost every one of you thousands of dollars a year. And just this week, his running mate, JD Vance, that guy from Ohio, JD Vance said they do not support $500 million federal investment to upgrade our auto plants. You cannot tell me you care about the people of Michigan if you're going to undermine the core of our economy in Michigan. So it's pretty simple. When you have a chance to save hundreds of good paying Michigan auto jobs and create more, you take it. Instead, the Trump Vance ticket is giving the middle finger to workers here in Michigan. It was the Biden Harris administration that took action to save union jobs. Donald Trump must think that Michiganders aren't very smart. Well, boy, do we have news for him, right? Because you can't go to Texas and love Elon Musk's EVs and then come here and denigrate EVs and the jobs that come along with him. I'm so tired of that guy saying one thing to people in a different state and coming here and saying another thing to Michiganders. We are not stupid. We know who stands up for us. We know the pain that when a factory leaves, it takes a whole lot with it. It means fewer kids in our local public schools. It means fewer first responders on the street and fewer local small businesses. No place in America knows this better than Flint, Michigan. When Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office, things finally started changing. Today, there are more auto workers than when Trump was president. There are more factories getting built three times as many as when Donald Trump was president. And the list goes on. More construction workers. More of those damn roads getting fixed. I never knew people would cheer so loud for roads. My God, I love it. More lead pipes being replaced. More middle class jobs. More on all of these fronts than when Donald Trump was president.",chunk_2,373

We are headed in the right direction and we're not going back. Clean energy project to everywhere in 124,000 jobs too. And hometown company here General Motors is investing a billion dollars in Flint assembly and Flint metal center to build heavy duty. That former president is the one who's railing against the Michigan economy and let me tell you we are building heavy duty gas powered trucks here. Let's go. So as president Kamala Harris knows that when we make more here in America, whether it's more energy, more cars, more batteries, more chips, we are stronger and the middle class grows. These chips are so important. They go in everything from your phone to your car to your dishwasher to your computer and everything else. And while Donald Trump worked against the chips act, Kamala Harris and Democrats got it over the finish line. And it's working. Chip factories are popping up all across America. We have proven that you can bring jobs back home and reduce our alliance on Chinese chips. But we need a leader who's willing to actually do the work. In his four years as president, Trump took us backwards. Kamala Harris has overseen a manufacturing boom. Thanks to her leadership. Yeah. Thanks to her leadership. We are growing the middle class and our economy is growing too. So this November, we have a very clear choice, a coordinated strategy to bring back manufacturing and glow grow the middle class, or the same old guy with the same old ideas about outsourcing and anti union leadership. So, Big Rich says let's vote for Kamala Harris. Let's win this thing. Thank you. Thank you. It's almost that time. Hey, rocket to the beat. Hey, y'all look sweet. I just got that word.

And what an outstanding cause to elect my friend Kamala Harris, President of the United States. I'm here because I've known Kamala for over 20 years. Cookie and I supported her run for Attorney General back in the state of California, her run for Senator. And now we support her as the VP, but now the biggest moment for all of us. November the 5th, we have to do all we can to elect Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States. She wants to build up the middle class and I know something about the middle class because I come from a middle class family. My father worked 30 years for Fisher body. When I turned pro, I thought that was going to be the greatest moment in my father's life, but it wasn't. The greatest moment in his life came when he finally owns his own home. What does Kamala Harris wants to do as President, put millions of Americans in their own home, give them $25,000 to start them off to be homeowners. That's very important. Then she wants to also have more small business owners and she's going to help them out by giving them $50,000 for start up new small business owners. Tax deduction. She's smart. She's strong. She's passionate. Nobody's going to out work her. She's committed to you as the people of the United States, the people of Michigan. She's committed to you. She's going to be a President for everybody. One thing she's going to do is finally unite us, bring us together. That other party is trying to tear us down. I say this because I'm back home. First of all, let me congratulate your Tigers. I grew up a Tiger fan. So I'm hoping that your Tigers meet my dodgers for the World Series. But we have 32 days. That sound familiar? Somebody wore number 32. You know who that is. Until November 5th. Now, we can't take anything for granted. You've been working hard, but we need to work harder. We've got to call people.

Kamala's opponent promised a lot of things last time to the black community that he did not deliver on. And we've got to make sure we help black men understand that. So that's why I'm here to make sure I help black men understand. First, get out and vote, and then vote for the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. She's for women's rights to make their own decision with their body. We've got to clap for them. Now, I'm about to bring her out because you came to hear her. You had some great speakers here.

We are not playing around. So listen, we know this election is about two very different visions for our nation. One focused on the past and ours which is focused on the future. We are fighting for a future where we tap into the ambitions and the aspirations of the American people and build what I call an opportunity economy so every American has an opportunity to own a home, build wealth, start a business. And I might speak about small business owners in the house right here. Right? Okay, so on the economy, I'm just going to spend a minute on small businesses.",chunk_7,412
2024-10-04,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Flint, Michigan",chunk,"Because let me tell you, growing up, our mother often worked very long hours. And so my sister Maya and I, we would go over to Micheltan's house. Micheltan was from Louisiana and we called her our second mother. And Micheltan was a small business owner. And so from being a child, I know who our small business owners are. They are community leaders, civic leaders, they mentor, they hire locally, they build up the community, they are part of the fabric of the community. And small business owners are the backbone of America's economy. So in my plan to build an opportunity economy, one of the things I will do is raise the startup deduction from $5,000 to $50,000 to help entrepreneurs start their small business. You heard Eric talk about it, we need to build more housing in America. You know, my mother saved up for years to buy our first homes. I was a teenager by the time she saved up enough to do that. And right now we know there's a serious housing shortage in our country and it is part of what is driving up costs. So we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes and provide first-time home buyers with a $25,000 down payment assistance. So you can just literally get your foot in the door and you'll handle the rest. We need to lower the cost of living. Look, our economy is making good progress. Just this morning we got a solid jobs report, right? Over 250,000 jobs created last month, unemployment fell, and just a few weeks ago the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, which helps. But there's still more we need to do. Prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. And I have a plan on lowering costs on everything from healthcare to groceries including taking on corporate price gouging. Because as Attorney General, I saw what happens where there are a few of them, not everybody, but those who take advantage of desperate people, in particular in the middle of an emergency, and there needs to be consequence. I will give a tax cut to 100 million Americans including $6,000 extending and expanding the child tax credit.",chunk_8,387

And look, I say all this to say, I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class and I will never forget where I come from. I will never forget where I come from. And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing. So over the last three and a half years, we have brought manufacturing back to America creating 730,000 manufacturing jobs. We announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States. And we did it by investing in American industry and American workers. And I will make sure that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century, which is why under my plan we will invest in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, and the great American auto industry. I see you, Sean. And we will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs from advanced batteries to electric vehicles are not only invented but built right here in America by American union workers. And Michigan, let us be clear, contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive. But here's what I will do. I will invest in communities like Flint. Flint, which helped build the auto industry and the UAW. We will retool existing factories higher locally and work with unions to create good paying jobs, including jobs that do not require a college degree. Because we understand a college degree is not the only measure of whether a worker has skills and experience to get the job done. In fact, part of my plan is to outline all of the federal jobs that should not require a college degree and make that clear, and when I'm elected, I'm going to challenge the private sector to take on the same approach.",chunk_9,375
2024-10-04,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Flint, Michigan",chunk,"And then there's Donald Trump. So Donald Trump has a very different approach. So Donald Trump makes big promises, and he always fails to deliver. He said he was the only one who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs. Remember that? And then America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president. Including tens of thousands of jobs in Michigan. And those losses started before the pandemic, making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history. And his track record for the auto industry was a disaster. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, I'll quote, not lose one plant during his presidency. And then American auto makers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president. We need a medic over here. We need a medic over here. Right here. Okay, can everyone part so that medic can come through please? Let's let the medic through. Okay. Okay. He's okay. All right. We're good. We got each other. Good. Good. Good. Good. So remembering again what Donald Trump talked about versus what he did. And then American auto makers announced the closure of six plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stalantis in Detroit. Thousands of Michigan auto workers lost their jobs. And when it came to building the cars of the future, Donald Trump sat on the sidelines and let China dominate. And then he talks down to American workers saying we can't compete with Chinese workers. And make no mistake, Donald Trump is no friend of labor. He encouraged automakers to move their plants out of Michigan so they could pay their workers less. And when the UAW went on strike to demand higher wages that they deserved, Donald Trump went to a non-union shop. Don't forget. And he attacked the UAW. And he said striking and collective bargaining don't make quote a damn bit of difference. Remember how he's talked about striking workers that you should fire them. That's how he talks about union labor. That's how he talks about workers.",chunk_10,350
2024-10-04,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Flint, Michigan",chunk,"But Flint, we know, we know strong unions mean higher wages, better healthcare, and greater dignity. For union members and for everyone. And on top of all of that, Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion tax cut that mostly went to the wealthy and big corporations, not to working people. And now he is making the same empty promises to the people of Michigan that he did before. But we will not be fooled. We will not be gaslighted. Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people. And if he wins again, it will be more of the same. Check this out. Two days ago, his running mate, maybe you saw that. No, but.. How about that Tim Walls, by the way? So two days ago, Donald Trump's running mate suggested that if Trump wins, he might let the Grand River Assembly plant in Lansing close down. The same plant that our administration helped save earlier this year along with 650 union jobs. Michigan, we together fought hard for those jobs. And you deserve a president who won't put them at risk. And for anybody watching, you know, if you want to learn more about Donald Trump's plans, just Google Project 2025. It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts, attack unions, cut social security and Medicare, and impose a Trump sales tax, a 20% tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average family nearly $4,000 a year. And on top of all this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. Even after he tried to repeal it time and time again when he was president, and still has no plan to replace it. You watched the debate. You watched the debate. You saw that. He said, he said he quote, has concepts of a plan. Concepts. You know, you know, I have said that I do believe he is an unserious man. And the consequences and the consequences of him being president again are absolutely critically serious. Because think about it, even on healthcare, he has a concept of a plan.

Ours is a fight for the future. Ours is a fight for the future. And ours is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And these 32 days out from the election, it is important that we remind people how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overturn Roe v. Wade. And they did. And now more than one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. And here's what I want to say. And that's not our only battle. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard fought, hard fought, won freedoms and rights. Like the freedom to vote. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to join a union. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. And the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water. Flint, you know all too well, Flint, that clean water should be a right for everyone, not just for the people who can afford it. And as President, I will continue to work with communities like Flint to ensure you not only have clean water, but the opportunity to recover economically and thrive. So Michigan, it all comes down to this. We are all here together because we know what is at stake. And we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. We love our country.

And I say everywhere I go look collective bargaining benefits everybody. And you know that the term and I'm looking at our young leaders who are here. I'm so glad you guys are here. So collective bargaining. It's really it's just a basic logical point. So here's what it means. It means that in any negotiation you want the outcome to be fair. Right. We all want fairness. Right. Everybody wants fairness or should. So here's the thing about collective bargaining. If you want the outcome to be fair you got to realize if you're requiring the one worker. To negotiate against the big entity. Do we really think that the outcome is going to be fair. Probably not. But if you let the workers together as the collective then negotiate against the big entity it's more likely that the outcome will be fair. That's the basic point of collective bargaining. That's the basic point of why we want our unions to be able to do their work on behalf of workers every day. Because we know when union wages go up everyone's wages go up. And when union workplaces are safer all workplaces are safer. And the bottom line is when unions are strong America is strong. And our unions have always fought to make our nation then more equal more fair and more free. And in this election in 32 days everything we have fought for is on the line. This election is about two very different visions for our nation. One that is focused on the past and ours that is focused on the future. We fight for a future where we protect the fundamental freedom to organize. We fight for a future where workers all workers are treated with dignity and respect. A future where we tap into the ambition and the aspirations of the American people and build what I call an opportunity economy. So that every American has an opportunity to buy a home start a business build wealth intergenerational wealth for their family. Over the last three and a half years our nation has seen historic small business creation as an example of that focus. In Michigan alone we have seen more than 500,000 new small business applications. And when I am president I plan to build on that progress and that success including by raising the start up deduction tax deduction for small businesses from $5,000 to $50,000 to help more entrepreneurs start a small business. I will tell you guys my sister and I were raised by our mother who worked very hard and we lived on an apartment above a daycare center. And it was run by and owned by the woman that we called our second mother who lived two houses down. She was a small business owner. And her name was Michelle Tyn. And I grew up as a child knowing about who our small businesses are right. They are leaders in the community. They are civic leaders. They hire locally. They train. And so that's one of the reasons I am focused on small businesses is part of how we lift up the middle class in America's economy. We need to also build more housing in America. Housing is too expensive. My mother saved up for years until I was a teenager when she was able to buy our first home. And right now we have a serious housing shortage in America and that's part of what is driving up cost. And so we are going to cut red tape. We are going to work with the private sector and we will build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term. Including providing first time home buyers with a $25,000 down payment assistance so they can just get their foot literally in the door to be able to invest in the American dream. Which not everyone has access to these days. We need to lower the cost of living. Because look our economy while we are making good progress just this morning in fact we got a solid jobs report. Over 250,000 jobs created last month. Unemployment fell. And just a few weeks ago the Federal Reserve cut down interest rates which is going to be great for a lot of folks. But there is still more work we need to do. Prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. And so we have a plan to lower costs on everything from healthcare to groceries including what I have done in my career as Attorney General. Which is we got to take on corporate price gouging. We got to take on what we need to do to understand that if you want to grow the middle class we need more middle class tax cuts. And the tax cut that is part of my plan will give a tax cut to 100 million Americans. We need to expand child tax credit. And I will do that to expand it to $6,000. So that for the first year of a child's life their parents have the resources that they need to be able to buy a crib or a car seat. And in that very critical stage of their child's development just be able to do more than get by. But be able to get ahead. And I say all this to say I will always put the middle class and working families first I come from the middle class and I will never forget where I come from. I will never forget where I come from. And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing. Over the last three and a half years we brought manufacturing back to America. We created 730,000 manufacturing jobs and announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States. And we did it by investing in American industry and American workers. And I want to make sure that America not China wins the competition for the 21st century. So under my plan we will invest in the industries that built America like steel, iron and the great American auto industry. Yeah. So we can ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs from advanced batteries to electric vehicles are not only invented but built right here in America by American union workers. So the election is in 32 days and Americans have a big choice to make. And I think it's very important then to point out Donald Trump has a very different approach than mine. And let's be real about who Donald Trump is. Let's be real. This is a time for real talk. He was handed $400 million on a silver platter and filed for bankruptcy six times. This is a man who has only ever fought for himself. This is a man who has been a union buster his entire career. Who has called union leaders quote, do's sucking people. And as president he did not lift a finger to save the pensions of millions of American workers. We did. We did. This is a man who sold promise after promise to American workers but never delivered. Who said he supports so called right to work laws 100%. Those are his words. He who joked and laughed about firing striking workers. You remember that? Who rolled back labor standards and made it easier for companies that break labor laws to get federal contracts. And Donald Trump is a man who tried to cut funding for our first responders including safer grants for firefighters. So brothers and sisters as we stand here in a house of labor. We will not be fooled. We will not be gaslighted. Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people. And he's trying to gaslight people all over our country. But we know the facts and we know the truth. He is an existential threat to America's labor movement. Just look at his track record to know. He said he was the only one who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs. Michigan knows what I'm about to say. Then America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president. Including tens of thousands of jobs in Michigan. And those losses started before the pandemic so we're clear. Making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history. And recall his record, his track record for the auto industry. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would quote not lose one plant during his presidency. Then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president. Including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit. Thousands of Michigan auto workers lost their jobs. And now he is making the same empty promises to the people of Michigan that he did before. Hoping you will forget how he let you down. But we know if he wins again, it will be more of the same. Everything he intends to do is spelled out in project 2025. If reelected, he intends to launch a full on attack on unions and the freedom to organize. He will ban public sector unions, roll back workplace safety protections, and appoint a union buster to run the Department of Labor. And on top of that, Donald Trump will give billionaires and the biggest corporations massive tax cuts like he did last time. He will cut Social Security and Medicare and impose what I call a Trump sales tax, a 20% tax on everyday goods and necessities. Which will cost the economist of said, which will cost the average American over $4,000 a year more. And if that weren't enough, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And even after he tried to repeal it time and time again when he was president, he still has no plan to replace it. Did you guys see the debate? Yes. Concepts of a plan. He has concepts of a plan. Come on. And you know I've said many times he is an unserious human. But the consequence of him is quite serious. Think about that concept of a plan. So he is going to threaten the health care and health coverage of 45 million people in America based on a concept. Think about that. To take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions, you remember what that was like? So look, I'm here to say, and I think we all know, it's time to turn the page. It's time to turn the page. America is ready to chart a new way forward because we are not going back. No we're not. And so it all comes down to this. We are here together because we know what is at stake. And we are here together, and I'm looking at the young leaders, because we love our country. We love our country. Yes, we do. We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. We have 32 days to get this done. And we know this is going to be a very tight race until the very end. And we are the underdog. So we have some hard work ahead of us. But I know who's here. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. And we know what we stand for, so we know what to fight for. We stand for opportunity. We stand for dignity. And we stand for the future. And so we know when we fight, we win. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",full,2555
2024-10-04,Event,"Harris delivered remarks in Detroit, Michigan",chunk,Good afternoon. I'm honored to be here to welcome Vice President Harris. Vice President Harris has the backs of workers and firefighters her entire career. She fought wage theft in California as a state's attorney general. In the Senate she fought to protect workers from extreme heat and supported legislation to make sure that every worker has the right to organize. As Vice President she helped increase our AFG and Safer grants to make sure we have the equipment we need to keep our community safe. Just last year Redford Township received 1.5 million for operations and safety. Vice President Harris has always stood with us and she always will. Across the country she makes it a point to visit firehouses and meet with our nation's firefighters. And like all of you I'm proud to cast my vote for her in November. Now it is my honor to introduce the next President of the United States. Kamala Harris. Thank you. Oh good afternoon everybody. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. It is my great honor to be with everybody this afternoon. Matt I want to thank you for your leadership and for all that you do for so many. You know everyone here you all have chosen to live a life of service in the most extraordinary way. And I'm so thankful to all of you to Matt for your leadership and everybody here. And it is so good to be in the House of Labor. Thank you. And you know yours is a profession that is more than a profession. It really is about a calling.

And I'm so thankful to you. You guys work long shifts with unpredictable hours and some of the most dangerous conditions. You do so on behalf of people you've never met.

Thank you. And of course I am thankful for the union that supports you and your right to all that you deserve in terms of the wages. And the benefits that you so rightly have earned.

In a few moments Doug and I will plant a tree here on the grounds of the residents of the vice president of the United States and we dedicate this tree to the 1200 innocent souls in an act of pure evil on October 7, 2023, who were massacred by Hamas terrorists. 46 of our fellow Americans were killed in this brutal terrorist attack, including a singer from Missouri who died shielding her son from bullets, an academic and peace activist who studied in Seattle and who was the grandson of Holocaust survivors, and a dancer from California who was killed alongside her fiance while attending the Nova Music Festival. I am devastated by the pain and loss that occurred on October 7 and Doug and I pray for the family and loved ones of all of those who were lost. And may their memories be a blessing. Today I know many Jews will be reciting and reflecting on the Jewish prayer for mourning, the kaddish, the words of the prayer are not about death. It is a prayer about our enduring belief in God, even in our darkest moments. So as we reflect on the horrors of October 7, let us please be reminded that we cannot lose faith.

So in this moment on the one year commemoration of October 7, what is asked of us? What is asked of us? First and foremost, I believe that we must never forget. I will never forget October 7 and the world must never forget. What is asked of us? We must work to ensure nothing like the horrors of October 7 can ever happen again. And on this solemn day, I will restate my pledge to always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world. What is asked of us? We must reunite the hostages held in Gaza with their families and I will never stop fighting for the release of all the hostages, including the American citizens living and deceased. Oh, Mayor, Idan, Sagi, Keith, Judy, God and it a. What is asked of us? We must uphold the commitment to repair the world. An idea that has been passed on throughout generations of the Jewish people and across many faiths. And to that end, we must work to relieve the immense suffering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza who have experienced so much pain and loss over the year. What is asked of us? We must continue to see light amidst the darkness as the late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks said. A people that can walk through the valley of the shadow of death and still rejoice is a people that cannot be defeated by any force or fear. That is why today we plant a pomegranate tree, which in Judaism is a symbol of hope and righteousness. So for years to come, this pomegranate tree will stand here, spreading its roots and growing stronger to remind future vice presidents of the United States, their families and all who pass through these grounds, not only of the horror of October 7th, but the strength and the endurance of the Jewish people.

2024-10-07,Interview,"Harris participated in a ""60 Minutes"" interview.",full,"Kamala Harris has been a candidate for president for just two and a half months, and the post-convention honeymoon is over. With the election just 29 days away, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walls, face unrelenting attacks from Donald Trump, and the race remains extremely close. We met the 59-year-old vice president this past week on the campaign trail, and later at the vice president's residence in Washington, D.C. We spoke about the economy and immigration, Ukraine and China, but we began with the escalating war in the Middle East one year after the Hamas terror attack on Israel. The story will continue in a moment. The events of the past few weeks have pushed us to the brink, if not into, and all out regional war in the Middle East. What can the U.S. do at this point to stop this from spinning out of control? Well, let's start with October 7. 1,200 people were massacred. 250 hostages were taken, including Americans. Women were brutally raped. And as I said then, I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself, we would, and how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end. We supply Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, and yet Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to be charting his own course. The Biden-Harris administration has pressed him to agree to a ceasefire. He's resisted. You urged him not to go into Lebanon. He went in anyway. Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu? The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles. But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end. Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu? I think with all due respect, the better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes. While the war in the Middle East has dominated recent headlines, it's the economy that most concerns American voters this election year as always. There are lots of signs that the American economy is doing very well, better than most countries I think, but the American people don't seem to be feeling it. Groceries are 25 percent higher and people are blaming you and Joe Biden for that. Are they wrong? We now have historic low unemployment in America among all groups of people. We now have an economy that is thriving by all macroeconomic measures. And to your point, prices are still too high. And I know that. And we need to deal with it, which is why part of my plan, you mentioned groceries. Part of my plan is what we must do to bring down the price of groceries. Harris says she'll press Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries, but details are yet to be defined. You want to expand the child tax credit. Yes, I do. You want to give tax breaks to first-time home buyers and people starting small businesses. But it is estimated by the nonpartisan committee for responsible federal budget that your economic plan would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. How are you going to pay for that? Okay. The other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it. My plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy. But pardon me, Madam Vice President. The question was, how are you going to pay for it? One of the things I'm going to make sure that the richest among us who can afford it pay their fair share in taxes. It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations. And I plan on making that fair. But we're dealing with the real world here. But the real world includes... How are you going to get this through Congress? You know, when you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about because their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about. Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses. Their constituents are middle class, hardworking folks. And Congress has shown no inclination to move in your direction. I disagree with you. There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit. None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy. Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that? I am also a capitalist. And I know the limitations of government. Pamela Harris has been in government for decades. She was first elected San Francisco District Attorney in 2003, then California Attorney General. She went on to the U.S. Senate and now Vice President. A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect? It's an election bill. And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support. You have to earn it. And that's what I intend to do. Let me tell you what your critics and the columnists say. Okay. They say that the reason so many voters don't know you is that you have changed your position on so many things. You were against fracking. Now you're for it. You supported looser immigration policies. Now you're tightening them up. You were for Medicare for all. Now you're not. So many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for. And I know you've heard that. In the last four years, I have been vice president of the United States. And I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are diverse people geographically, regionally in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. And what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing as long as you don't compromise your values to find common sense solutions. And that has been my approach. But one issue that has proven impervious to compromise is immigration. Over the past four years, the Biden-Harris approach has been inconsistent. And Republicans are convinced immigration is the vice president's Achilles heel. You recently visited the southern border and embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers. And that crackdown produced an almost immediate and dramatic decrease in the number of border crossings. If that's the right answer now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021? The first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system, knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up. Fast forward to a moment when a bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, got together, came up with a border security bill. Well, guess what happened? Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress, kill the bill, don't let it move forward. But I've been covering the border for years. And so I know this is not a problem that started with your administration. Correct, correct. But there was an historic flood of undocumented immigrants coming across the border. The first three years of your administration, as a matter of fact, arrivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump. Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did? It's a longstanding problem. And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions. What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place? I think the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem. Okay? But the numbers did quadruple. And the numbers today, because of what we have done, we have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half. We have cut the flow of fentanyl by half. But we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem. You have accused Donald Trump of using racist tropes when it comes to Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, when it comes to Bartherism, when it comes to Charlottesville. In fact, you have called him a racist and divisive. That Donald Trump has the support of millions and millions of Americans. How do you explain that? I'm glad you are pointing these comments out that he has made that have resulted in a response by most reasonable people to say it's just wrong. It's just wrong. With so many people supporting Donald Trump, the man you have called a racist, how do you bridge that seemingly unbridgeable gap? I believe that the people of America want a leader who's not trying to divide us and demean. I believe that the American people recognize that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it's based on who you lift up. The Harris campaign has been hopscotching the country, and with less than a month to go, the pace is picking up. The vice president told us she has lost track of how many states she's visited. How are you doing? I'm doing well. You well? We joined her on the trail late last week in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin in the town of Ripon, the birthplace in 1854 of the Republican Party. And at a rally plastered with country over party banners, Harris appeared with staunch conservative Liz Cheney. As vice chair of the House January 6th committee, Cheney became one of Donald Trump's fiercest critics. I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. That proclamation spurred a chant of approval from the crowd. Four years ago, if someone had told you that you would be campaigning with Liz Cheney, what would you have said to them? That'd be great. It's really diplomatic. Would you ever have thought that you'd be campaigning with Kamala Harris? I hope that if you had said to me four years ago, our Constitution is going to be under threat, and it's going to be crucial for the parties to come together and to support Vice President Harris because she'll defend the rule of law. I know I would have said that's exactly what I'll do. I thank you all. Whoever wins the presidency will take on a host of daunting challenges, especially beyond our borders. Back in Washington, Vice President Harris told us she's determined the U.S. must win the economic competition with China for the 21st century. And as for the war between Russia and Ukraine, what does success look like in ending the war in Ukraine? There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the UN Charter participating in what that success looks like. Would you meet with President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a solution to the war in Ukraine? Not bilaterally without Ukraine. No. Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine. As president, would you support the effort to expand NATO to include Ukraine? Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression. Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kiev right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender. A hard left turn here, but you recently surprised people when you said that you are a gun owner. And then if someone came into your house... That was not the first time I've talked about it. That's not the first time I've talked about it. So what kind of gun do you own and when and why did you get it? I have a Glock and I've had it for quite some time. And I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement. And so there you go. Have you ever fired it? Yes. Of course I have. At a shooting range. Yes, of course I have. When we come back, Vice Presidential Candidate Tim Walz gets the 60 Minutes Treatment and Kamala Harris talks about why Donald Trump decided not to. Democratic Vice Presidential Candidate Tim Walz was little known outside Minnesota just two months ago. He didn't exactly come from nowhere. He was a six term congressman and now is governor of Minnesota where he has championed abortion rights, gun control and other progressive ideas. But it was calling former President Trump and Senator J.D. Vance weird that may have landed him on the ticket. The story will continue in a moment. Two months ago you and Kamala Harris barely knew each other. Now you're running together vying for the top offices in the land. It's not possible that you agree on everything. What have been some disagreements you've had since you became a team? Well, she probably disagreed with you said Tim, you know, you need to be a little more careful on how you say things, whatever it might be. Whatever it might be, Walz has been criticized for embellishing or telling outright falsehoods about his military record and about his travels to Asia in the 1980s. In your debate with J.D. Vance, you said I'm a knucklehead at times. And I think you were referring to the time that you said that you were in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square unrest when you were not. Is that kind of misrepresentation, isn't that more than just being a knucklehead? I think folks know who I am and I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion telling a story, getting a date wrong rather than a pathological liar like Donald Trump. But I think it comes down to the question of whether you can be trusted to tell the truth. Yeah, well, I think I can. I will own up to being a knucklehead at times, but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word. Walz proudly touts his record as governor of Minnesota, but it also has opened him up to criticism from his Republican opponents. Former President Trump says that you and your administration here in Minnesota has been dangerously liberal. Radical left, he calls it. So what do you say to that criticism that rather than leading the way, you and Minnesota are actually out of step with the rest of the country? President Trump may be referring to that our children get breakfast and lunch in school so that they can learn. He may be talking about we have a paid family medical leave policy that was promoted by the business community. Donald Trump spends his time tearing down states rather than lifting up the things we do, the best of it. Donald Trump's critiques of that, not only are they wrong, but I'm waiting for what is his solution. Here in Minnesota, we're so optimistic we walk on water half the year. It was that kind of humor and candor that helped land Tim Walz the job as Kamala Harris' running mate. Before you joined the ticket, you called Republicans weird. And that's sort of become a rallying cry for Democrats. Why do you think that label stuck? I was really talking about the behaviors, being obsessed with people's personal lives in their bedrooms and their reproductive rights, making up stories about legal folks legally here, eating cats and dogs. They're dehumanizing. They go beyond weird because I said this, it becomes almost dangerous. Let's debate policy in a real way and let's try and find an objective truth again. God bless America! Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are in a full sprint to November 5th, hoping their arguments will give them a chance to cross the line ahead of Donald Trump and JD Vance. You are sitting here with us. The Trump campaign canceled an interview that they had agreed to, to participate in this broadcast. What do you make of that? If he is not going to give your viewers the ability to have a meaningful, thoughtful conversation and question and answer with you, then watch his rallies. You're going to hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances. And what you will not hear is anything about you, the listener. You will not hear about how he's going to try to bring the country together, find common ground. And Bill, that is why I believe in my soul and heart. The American people are ready to turn the page. More from the Democratic ticket, plus one year covering rapidly escalating conflict in the Middle East. Civilians caught in the middle as always are the ones suffering the most.

2024-10-07,Interview,"Harris participated in a ""60 Minutes"" interview.",chunk,"Kamala Harris has been a candidate for president for just two and a half months, and the post-convention honeymoon is over. With the election just 29 days away, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walls, face unrelenting attacks from Donald Trump, and the race remains extremely close. We met the 59-year-old vice president this past week on the campaign trail, and later at the vice president's residence in Washington, D.C. We spoke about the economy and immigration, Ukraine and China, but we began with the escalating war in the Middle East one year after the Hamas terror attack on Israel. The story will continue in a moment. The events of the past few weeks have pushed us to the brink, if not into, and all out regional war in the Middle East. What can the U.S. do at this point to stop this from spinning out of control? Well, let's start with October 7. 1,200 people were massacred. 250 hostages were taken, including Americans. Women were brutally raped. And as I said then, I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself, we would, and how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.

We know what four more years of Donald Trump can do. We know how dangerous it can be. Let's mentally take ourselves to the future. 26 nights from now, election night, when the polls close and the results are coming in. We'll be asking ourselves a few questions when the polls close. Could I have done more to save our democracy? Could I have done more to protect abortion rights? Could I have done more to protect marriage equality? On behalf of every person who will face the wrath of MAGA decisions, I'm asking you, will you commit to work harder over in the next 26 days? I'm asking you, will you commit to work harder over in the next 26 days? I'm asking you, will you commit to work harder over in the next 26 days?

My name is Carson, and I'm a field organizer working to elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States! It is an honor to stand here looking at a group of incredible people and outstanding Americans who are ready to engage in the spirit of democracy as everyone in this country has a right to do. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! That beautiful part of our country is why I stand before you today. A few years ago, I found myself on a day off, met up with a friend from college who I hadn't seen in a while thanks to the pandemic. We got coffee at a bookstore, and as she was talking, you know, my eyes kept on drifting. To the top left of the cafe where there was a TV sitting there. On that TV, there was a crowd gathering in front of the White House. More and more people gathered by the hour as we continued to speak throughout the day. Eventually, we went our separate ways. I drove home, quiet, thinking about that TV. When I got home, I walked into the kitchen where my parents were watching the news. I stood in the doorway glued to that television. That crowd that I was watching was now a full-scale riot on the steps of our nation's capital. I saw smoke and fire and fear strike at the heart of our nation, of every idea that makes our country great. I always loved my country, about what America truly meant to its people and to the world. And I saw nothing short of an attack upon what this country stands for. My mother and my father, both Republicans, were quiet as we watched together. And finally, putting aside politics and an gesture of care, my father had to ask me, Are you okay? He saw the tears in my eyes, and he understood the weight of that moment and what it represented. January 6th was about more than just party politics. It was about the respect of our institutions and all that we stand for. I became an organizer because in the shadow of despair, I want to see hope prevail. On January 6th, our republic held true, strong in the face of its greatest foe, the threat of tyranny. President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and all those who protected our democracy that day are why I traveled all the way from New Orleans to Phoenix. Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walts inspire that hope, joy and greatness in both our country and ourselves. With Vice President Harris at the top of the ticket, Americans everywhere can look forward to the policies of progress from greater opportunities to the middle and lower class, to enriching our rural and urban classrooms, to protecting a woman's right to choose and her reproductive rights and freedoms. Vice President Harris will also protect our institutions. She will fight for bipartisan solutions, allowing us to come together not as Democrats or as Republicans, but as Americans. So today, I'm asking you to join us in action. It's our duty to help elect Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walts to the White House. The election in Arizona will be won at the doors and on the phones. So sign up with an organizers, all of my fellow organizers, to take action so that we can make a difference here in Arizona. And look y'all, I love y'all, but it's going to take every one of us together. So we need each and every one of you to join us out there. Now, thank you all so much for joining us here today. But more importantly, I cannot wait to see you all there in DC on Inauguration Day!

A future where it's cooler to read books than to ban them. I'm grateful that so many Arizonans have gotten to know Kamala Harris the way I've gotten to know her. She cares about all of us and wants the very best for every American, for every family. My friends, there are 26 days left until we elect our next president. We know the MAGA plan. Desperate Donald and the MAGA crowd, they want to scare us with lies, lies and more lies. They're even trying to convince their supporters that Democrats now control hurricanes. You cannot make this up. They offer scare tactics, but Kamala Harris offers hope. Combine hope and hard work, and that's a recipe to win an election. It's no accident that Vice President Harris and all the top candidates on both sides are in Arizona this week.

2024-10-11,Event,"Harris speaks at campaign event in Scottsdale, Arizona",full,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you for all the support that you have given us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So we are all here together because we love our country. We love our country. And I was talking with some folks recently about the importance of understanding the duality, frankly, that exists in terms of our democracy. As your Vice President, I have now met over 150 world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. And when we, representing the United States, walk in those rooms, traditionally we've been able to walk in those rooms, chin up, shoulders back, with the earned and self-appointed authority to talk about the importance of democracies, rule of law. But I say to a room of role models, here's the thing about being a role model. When you're a role model, folks watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say. And I tell you because I have traveled the country recently, including the many, many trips that I have taken over the last almost four years, but recently, in particular, where world leaders, allies, have come up to me. And now on a first name basis, I've met with so many of them so many times. And they have said to me, Kamala, I hope you guys are going to be okay. One of the things that I think about and weighs on me sometimes is I hope we as Americans really understand how important we are to the world. We are so important to the world. Those people who fight for democracy, who fight for freedom, who fight for a life in which they can have opportunity, they hold us up and they hold us out as a model. And that, as much as anything is at stake right now in this election. And I know I'm speaking to a group of people who know that and know that well. You know, I was raised to believe that hard work is important. It is important to look out for each other. It is important to understand that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. I was raised in a community of folks who understood that when we stand together, when we look for commonality, that's when we thrive. And part of what we know has been happening in the last several years in our country is there's some powerful forces that are trying to divide us as Americans would have us and cheer us on if we point fingers at one another. There's this kind of backward thinking coming from some folks that suggests that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we know, which is the real measure of the strength of a leader, is based on who you lift up. That's strength. But truly, I mean that intentionally. It's not only good and right, that strength, because that's part of what is the perversion of what some people are suggesting. As though it is a sign of weakness, to have empathy, to have some level of concern and care about the suffering of other people, and then take it upon oneself to do something about that, that is about lifting the condition of your fellow human being. So when we think about what's at stake in this election, whoa, it's packed with some stuff. It's packed with some fundamental stuff. I say rather articulately. There's so much at stake. Mayor, you mentioned John McCain. Okay, so I'll tell you, I was in the United States Senate for about four years, and I worked with John McCain. And so I'll tell you, we were on a committee together, and these committee rooms in the United States Senate, they were very grand and very impressive. John McCain was on one side of the dice, I was on the other, horseshoe. And he's going after me. He's going after me. We're having some conversation. I think it was about one of the nominees. This is during the President Trump's years. He's going after me. And I'm going back after him. I'm going back after him. And that was it, and this is what the public saw. And then I step onto the floor of the well of the Senate. Later that day we had votes, and I passed by John McCain, and he looks at me and he says, Kid, come over here. You're going to make a great senator. True story, true story, true story. That was John McCain. That was John McCain. I was talking about him last night at a rally, right? John McCain, who, you know, we didn't agree on everything, but man, I mean, what about an incredible American hero? Again, strength, strength, right? We know what the former president said about John McCain. I'm not going to repeat it here, but strength. John McCain stood on principle. He stood on a belief in the importance of patriotism, of sacrifice, of what we stand for as a country. And part of what I talked about at a rally last night is, I shared with the folks in the room. I was there on the Senate floor, way into the middle of the night, when it was yet another attempt of the former president to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which, as we know, has been literally a lifesaver for people, right? What it has done to no longer allow pre-existing conditions to be the reason that an insurance company can't give you assistance, right? And you all may have seen it. I was there on the floor that night, and we were all standing around because whether or not the Affordable Care Act would continue to be relied on one vote, and we were all standing on the floor. And of course, I had voted to keep going, and I say this, and it sounds like it's out of a movie, but this is how I experienced it, on the floor with my colleagues, and the Senate, well, it was late into the night, and in the Senate, you walk onto the Senate floor, and there were these big wooden ornate doors, and those ornate doors opened, and John McCain came out. And he went to the floor, and he said, No, you don't. I said, No, you don't. No, you don't take away health care for millions of people. And that is but one example of an individual that we all respect who put country before party in terms of what they thought was right. I am honored to have the endorsement of Jeff Flake, someone I also worked with. Again, putting country before party. And so I say all of that to say that those are examples that are situated right here in this beautiful state of Arizona. A tradition that everyone and all of us, I will say, stand on. And then of course, most recently, what Maricopa did in terms of the clerk refusing to participate in the intention to undo the will of the people who have been in a free and fair election. The people of this state have always shown extraordinary courage to stand up for the principles upon which we as a country were founded. And I thank you for that. I thank you for that. I know we are going to win this election, and it is not going to be easy. There are forces at play that are making us as Americans, and I think call into question certain fundamentals that we have always taken for granted that is part of our pride. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom from the government making decisions about a person's body, a woman's body. Freedom to just be. Freedom over matters of heart and home, I like to say. Fundamental principles around the importance of rule of law. Whether we should actually be concerned and have a question, a legitimate question in an election for president of the United States, the commander in chief of whether they will abide by the oath. But imagine, imagine, that's a legitimate question we are asking. It's not rhetorical. It's a legitimate question we are asking. He who said that he would quote, terminate the Constitution of the United States. He who said he would be a dictator on day one. He who intends to weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. Take away the independence of the Department of Justice and put in place loyalists, fundamental notions about who and what we are as a democracy. Are at play in this election. And you all, each of you, have had the courage to say, hey, we may not agree on every single thing. That's also what a democracy looks like. But foundational first principles cannot be in question. Not for the sake of our children, not for the sake of our future and well-being, not for the sake of our standing in the world. And so I tell you all this to just reaffirm that we share not only a concern but a commitment to our country and what's most important. About in a moment of crisis, dare I say, I think this is one, do we stand together as Americans being our first identity and come together around these issues? And I'm going to actually announce, we have press in the room, that I have decided also not only will I have a Republican in my cabinet, but I'm also going to, I was talking to my team about it, I want to create some structure around the following, which is I love good ideas, wherever they come from, I love good ideas. Right? And so part of what I intend to do, Mayor, and put some structure around, is creating a bipartisan council of advisors who can then give feedback on policy as we go forward. Because here's the thing I also understand and feel strongly about. In order for us as America to maintain our status as the strongest democracy in the world, we need a healthy two-party system. We have to have a healthy two-party system. We have to. It's in the best interest of all of us. It's in the best interest of all of us. You know, the way that I like to lead, I bring folks in my office all the time, and they know I don't want any yes people. I want people to come in and, first of all, be prepared. Yeah, no time to waste, but come in and then let's, as I often say, kick the tires on ideas. Because the best ideas will survive those kinds of challenges, and the best ideas will then be most relevant to the American people, most effective to the American people. And so I'm going to create a bipartisan council so we can put some structure around exactly this point and do the work that is important. And then I'm just going to close with this. You know, again, I think on the fundamentals, we have more in common than what separates us, including across faiths. So I know there are a lot of members of the LDS community here, and you may or may not know my pastor actually spoke at the 100th birthday of President Nelson. Yeah. Yeah. And I just, and that wasn't a plan as part of this. It just is. And I just think if we think in our lives and in what we know, there's so many examples of that point. We have so much more in common than what separates us, especially on the fundamentals. And so with that, I say that I am committed to all of you to be a president for all Americans and to work as we must together. Again, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us and on the biggest and most important issues, I think we know that this is a fight that is not against something, as much as it is a fight that is for something. Thank you. God bless you. God bless you. And God bless you, and I will see you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah.",full,2143

Thank you for all the support that you have given us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So we are all here together because we love our country. We love our country. And I was talking with some folks recently about the importance of understanding the duality, frankly, that exists in terms of our democracy. As your Vice President, I have now met over 150 world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. And when we, representing the United States, walk in those rooms, traditionally we've been able to walk in those rooms, chin up, shoulders back, with the earned and self-appointed authority to talk about the importance of democracies, rule of law. But I say to a room of role models, here's the thing about being a role model. When you're a role model, folks watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say. And I tell you because I have traveled the country recently, including the many, many trips that I have taken over the last almost four years, but recently, in particular, where world leaders, allies, have come up to me. And now on a first name basis, I've met with so many of them so many times. And they have said to me, Kamala, I hope you guys are going to be okay. One of the things that I think about and weighs on me sometimes is I hope we as Americans really understand how important we are to the world. We are so important to the world. Those people who fight for democracy, who fight for freedom, who fight for a life in which they can have opportunity, they hold us up and they hold us out as a model. And that, as much as anything is at stake right now in this election.",chunk_1,392
2024-10-11,Event,"Harris speaks at campaign event in Scottsdale, Arizona",chunk,"And I know I'm speaking to a group of people who know that and know that well. You know, I was raised to believe that hard work is important. It is important to look out for each other. It is important to understand that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. I was raised in a community of folks who understood that when we stand together, when we look for commonality, that's when we thrive. And part of what we know has been happening in the last several years in our country is there's some powerful forces that are trying to divide us as Americans would have us and cheer us on if we point fingers at one another. There's this kind of backward thinking coming from some folks that suggests that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we know, which is the real measure of the strength of a leader, is based on who you lift up. That's strength. But truly, I mean that intentionally. It's not only good and right, that strength, because that's part of what is the perversion of what some people are suggesting. As though it is a sign of weakness, to have empathy, to have some level of concern and care about the suffering of other people, and then take it upon oneself to do something about that, that is about lifting the condition of your fellow human being. So when we think about what's at stake in this election, whoa, it's packed with some stuff. It's packed with some fundamental stuff. I say rather articulately. There's so much at stake. Mayor, you mentioned John McCain. Okay, so I'll tell you, I was in the United States Senate for about four years, and I worked with John McCain. And so I'll tell you, we were on a committee together, and these committee rooms in the United States Senate, they were very grand and very impressive. John McCain was on one side of the dice, I was on the other, horseshoe. And he's going after me. He's going after me. We're having some conversation. I think it was about one of the nominees.",chunk_2,378
2024-10-11,Event,"Harris speaks at campaign event in Scottsdale, Arizona",chunk,"This is during the President Trump's years. He's going after me. And I'm going back after him. I'm going back after him. And that was it, and this is what the public saw. And then I step onto the floor of the well of the Senate. Later that day we had votes, and I passed by John McCain, and he looks at me and he says, Kid, come over here. You're going to make a great senator. True story, true story, true story. That was John McCain. That was John McCain. I was talking about him last night at a rally, right? John McCain, who, you know, we didn't agree on everything, but man, I mean, what about an incredible American hero? Again, strength, strength, right? We know what the former president said about John McCain. I'm not going to repeat it here, but strength. John McCain stood on principle. He stood on a belief in the importance of patriotism, of sacrifice, of what we stand for as a country. And part of what I talked about at a rally last night is, I shared with the folks in the room. I was there on the Senate floor, way into the middle of the night, when it was yet another attempt of the former president to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which, as we know, has been literally a lifesaver for people, right? What it has done to no longer allow pre-existing conditions to be the reason that an insurance company can't give you assistance, right? And you all may have seen it. I was there on the floor that night, and we were all standing around because whether or not the Affordable Care Act would continue to be relied on one vote, and we were all standing on the floor. And of course, I had voted to keep going, and I say this, and it sounds like it's out of a movie, but this is how I experienced it, on the floor with my colleagues, and the Senate, well, it was late into the night, and in the Senate, you walk onto the Senate floor, and there were these big wooden ornate doors, and those ornate doors opened, and John McCain came out. And he went to the floor, and he said, No, you don't. I said, No, you don't.",chunk_3,393
2024-10-11,Event,"Harris speaks at campaign event in Scottsdale, Arizona",chunk,"No, you don't take away health care for millions of people. And that is but one example of an individual that we all respect who put country before party in terms of what they thought was right. I am honored to have the endorsement of Jeff Flake, someone I also worked with. Again, putting country before party. And so I say all of that to say that those are examples that are situated right here in this beautiful state of Arizona. A tradition that everyone and all of us, I will say, stand on. And then of course, most recently, what Maricopa did in terms of the clerk refusing to participate in the intention to undo the will of the people who have been in a free and fair election. The people of this state have always shown extraordinary courage to stand up for the principles upon which we as a country were founded. And I thank you for that. I thank you for that. I know we are going to win this election, and it is not going to be easy. There are forces at play that are making us as Americans, and I think call into question certain fundamentals that we have always taken for granted that is part of our pride. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom from the government making decisions about a person's body, a woman's body. Freedom to just be. Freedom over matters of heart and home, I like to say. Fundamental principles around the importance of rule of law. Whether we should actually be concerned and have a question, a legitimate question in an election for president of the United States, the commander in chief of whether they will abide by the oath. But imagine, imagine, that's a legitimate question we are asking. It's not rhetorical. It's a legitimate question we are asking. He who said that he would quote, terminate the Constitution of the United States. He who said he would be a dictator on day one. He who intends to weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. Take away the independence of the Department of Justice and put in place loyalists, fundamental notions about who and what we are as a democracy.",chunk_4,370

And you all, each of you, have had the courage to say, hey, we may not agree on every single thing. That's also what a democracy looks like. But foundational first principles cannot be in question. Not for the sake of our children, not for the sake of our future and well-being, not for the sake of our standing in the world. And so I tell you all this to just reaffirm that we share not only a concern but a commitment to our country and what's most important. About in a moment of crisis, dare I say, I think this is one, do we stand together as Americans being our first identity and come together around these issues?

2024-10-14,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with The Shade Room,full,"President Barack Obama, he was campaigning for you in Pittsburgh before some students at the University of Pittsburgh, which is my alma mater. And he said some things that really ruffled some feathers in the news. He said, it makes me think you aren't just feeling the idea of having a woman as a president. You're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that. We have not seen the same kind of energy and turnout in all corners of our neighborhoods and community as we saw when I was running. So when you hear those words, I'm sure you were briefed on the situation. You know, a former Ohio State Senator, Nina Turner, she came out on CNN and said, why are you, you know, putting black men up against the wall and pressuring them into something that possibly, you know, they don't want to do if they want to vote for you or not. So my question to you is, do you think that what President Obama said was the right thing to say? I'm Justin Carter on Brown here in Greenville, North Carolina with the Vice President, Kamala Harris. She's announcing something big, not only for black men, but for all black people. We also talked HBCUs. We talked Beyonce. It's all coming up on a special edition and exclusive CSR news. Vice President Kamala Harris in the building VP, are you with me? I'm with you. So good to see you again, Justin. Thank you. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's been so long. It feels great. It has been a whirlwind for you. I feel good. You know, listen, we have 23 days as of today until the election, and I am in these streets traveling and talking with folks. We're here in North Carolina. It's very exciting. You know what's exciting for me is like the rally we're about to do this afternoon in states around our country. People by the thousands are packing these rooms, but the thing that I love about it is people of every different kind of background coming together. And there's so much about how I feel about our message and our movement, if you will, that is grounded in certain beliefs, including the fact that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And it's so important to me that over the course of this campaign, we must win. That's our first imperative, no doubt. But that we build up community, right? And coalitions. I think that's so important. One big theme of your campaign has been freedom. Yes. Freedom, right? Yes. Freedom, freedom, I can't live. I'm not going to mess up the words, but I don't want to get sued by Beyonce. And there are a couple of versions that she has, right? So did you call up the queen? Like, how did that work? Well, she absolutely gave me permission to use the song. I love her. And... Have you met her? I have met her, but not since I've been running just now, but I have met her. And she's just very special. Yeah. Talk about freedom and what that means to you, why that song. It's just imperative. It's crucial right now, what's going on in 2024. I think that there is so much about what is at stake that is, frankly, the need for us to fight for the things that we hold dear, that we have always had to fight for, but must continue to fight for if they're going to be in attack. And frankly, just to be very candid with you, I am seeing across our country a full-on attempt by some to attack these hard-won freedoms and rights, right? The freedom to vote. In Georgia, for example, they passed a law making it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote, which the hypocrisy abounds. Whatever happened to love thy neighbor? You look at the freedom to make decisions for a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. The freedom to just be is under attack in so many places. The freedom to be safe from gun violence, right? And so there is so much about what's at stake in this election that really is about fighting for freedom because the difference between me and my opponent, the former president, Donald Trump, couldn't be more different on so many of these issues. And so I'm so proud and it always just gives me an extra pet because Beyoncé's freedom is my walk on song in all of these rallies. And did you guys share a moment, you and Beyoncé? I mean, you know, what was that conversation like? Well, she and I have, I'll tell you the last time that I saw her was a couple years ago at actually a BT event. And I mean, she's, you know, and her mother, though, I've been seeing a lot of reason because Beyoncé's been on a tour. She's been doing her thing. Tina is so amazing. Woman of the Year, glamour. Yeah. She's very special. She's very special. She's been supporting me for years. And she actually, the last time I talked to her, she was organizing hairstylists and women who have salons and, you know, who are incredible small business owners to get involved around getting out the vote. Speaking of getting out the vote, you guys are on an HBCU tour. Yes, we are. That's amazing. Come on, HU, you know. You know, you know. In fact, I was with a group of incredible distinguished men last night in North Carolina. And we were all, you know, because we, and they were all, you know, there to support my candidacy and to talk about their, their, a lot of them are business owners. But then, you know, we, I'm not going to say we digress, but we definitely got into it about who went to which school. Well, that was my, that's what I was going to ask you. And had a healthy level of disrespect for each other. Well, man, well, this next question might be, you know, a little controversial. So if you didn't go to Howard, is there another school? I can't imagine a world like that. Would you be a spellman? Do you like, would you be a spellman girl? Would you go to Famu? You know, they're very prideful down there in Florida. And they should be. And there was a reason that Howard is called the Mecca. And I'm very proud to be a bison. See, but we all have fun with each other. But you know what? We have fun with each other. Because here's the thing that we know all of us, whether it, I mean, you mentioned all the schools, whether it be spell, spellmen, Famu, all the, the Morehouse, I mean, all, Shaw, all these schools. We have, we have fun banter among us that is absolutely rooted in a collective pride that we share about our HBCU roots, because it is a very special experience. And it is something that gives us a kindred, I think, look on life about, about pride and about the pride in, in the success that we collectively achieve, a knowledge that we collectively stand on very broad shoulders of, of those historic leaders who graduated from each of these schools. And it is actually with that spirit and that sense of family that then we give each other a hard time about which school does what. It's all good fun. It's in good fun. It's good. It's good fun. It's good fun. And obviously we're, we're walking into a week where, you know, you've been talking about really encouraging black men specifically to get out and vote. And I do want to talk about the numbers. I crunched some numbers at three o'clock this morning. Okay. Okay. There was a poll on Saturday. It said that almost 80% of likely black voters would vote for you if the election were held today. In 2020, though, it was 90% of black voters overall. That was from the New York Times and Santa College. And then in 2016, you know, they also had a poll, the Pew Research Center. They said 81% of black men voted for Hillary Clinton, 14% voted for Trump. In 2020, though, that number jumped 6%. So 87% of black men voted for Biden, 12% voted for Trump in 2020. So when you hear those numbers and you're seeing, you know, in the polls and you're seeing black men aren't as, quote, excited or fired up for you, how do you respond to that? Well, that's not my experience. Okay. One, that's not my experience. Two, Election Day has not arrived yet. Okay. And the third point that is probably the most important point is this. You know, when journalists ask me this question, I often will say to them that, you know, let's be clear that your underlying premise is not an assumption that I'm supposed to have black men in my back pocket in terms of their vote and that I should be, I should be taking that for granted because I don't. Black men are no different from anybody else. They expect that you have to earn their vote. And that's why I'm out here doing the work that I'm doing about talking with folks, listening with folks, because I'm running for president in the United States and it is incumbent on me to earn the support. And that is why I'm talking with folks about the work that I have done in my career, whether it be in particular as vice president, what I've done to put more billions of dollars actually into community banks to increase access to capital for small business owners. Even before I was running for president, I convened a bunch of black small business owners, all who were men, and I purposely convened them to, I brought them into my ceremonial office at the White House to have a meeting about what their needs are and to make sure that they have the information about what's available to them in terms of financing capital and access to capital, support for what they want to do in terms of building or growing their business. So that's the kind of work I will continue to do. But here's the other thing that I think is equally important is pointing out that there are two very different visions for our nation that are being presented to voters right now. On the one side you've got Donald Trump, who wants to take us backward. Donald Trump, who let's not forget when he was renting his apartments and his property, refused to rent to black families. Donald Trump, who as it relates to five young black men, they were actually teenagers and Latinos. The Central Park Five, he took out a full page ad in the New York Times calling for their execution. They were innocent. Donald Trump, who referred to the first black president and suggested, remember the birtherism lies, that he couldn't have been born in the United States. Donald Trump, who in his project 2025, you know that the various things that would happen would include allowing it or making it easier for companies to not give workers overtime pay. We cap the cost of prescription medication at $2,000 a year for seniors and cap the cost of insulin at $35 for our seniors. That's our grandparents. Our parents. Black folks are 60% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. His plan would eliminate that cap. So part of the reason that I am out here talking with folks, listening to folks is to make sure that I am communicating and letting them know about the real contrast that is being presented. Because my bottom line is this. I know the power that people have to make a difference. And I respect that power. And I am out here doing the work of earning then the vote so that we can get to the job of continuing to move forward. And for me, that is about pushing for an opportunity economy, which is about tapping into the ambitions and the aspirations of folks and doing the work of investing in community, investing in industries, strengthening our economy, and giving people dignity in the process. Now you have a friend. His name is Barack Hussein Obama. You know him? I do know him. I do. He recently in Pittsburgh. President. President. President. Let's get it right. President Barack Obama. He was campaigning for you in Pittsburgh before some students at the University of Pittsburgh, which is my alma mater. And he said some things that really ruffled some feathers in the news. He said, it makes me think you aren't just feeling the idea of having a woman as a president. You're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that. We have not seen the same kind of energy and turnout in all corners of our neighborhoods and community as we saw when I was running. So when you hear those words, I'm sure you were briefed on the situation. You know, a former Ohio State Senator, Nina Turner, she came out on CNN and said, why are you, you know, putting black men up against the wall and pressuring them into something that possibly, you know, they don't want to do if they want to vote for you or not. So my question to you is, do you think that what President Obama said was the right thing to say? Let me tell you, I am very proud to have the support of President Obama and that he is out traveling to talk with voters about what is at stake in this election. I'm very proud to have his support. What is also important is one, to understand, like as I said, I intend to earn the vote of everyone, including black men. Two, pay attention to everything that President Obama talked about because he also talked about at length the danger of Donald Trump, the danger of Donald Trump in terms of somebody who has said that they would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies, somebody who has referred to black immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, legal immigrants as though they would eat their pets, constantly perpetuating tropes. Remember he who, Donald Trump, who said in Charlottesville, they're good people on each side. So I think it's really important to focus on the stakes of this election and there are two choices, two choices. And I ask everyone to look at the background, look at the work, look at the words to have a sense of how you then choose to use the power of your vote on election day. But there is a very big difference between Donald Trump and how I will be President of the United States and I cannot impress upon people enough that this is somebody, Donald Trump, who intends to take us backward. Look, this man won't even debate me a second time. He won't even debate me a second time. He didn't do the 60 minutes interview, which I believe every presidential candidate for President of the United States has done. He will not take up the important responsibility that every presidential candidate has done of showing their medical records. Okay? Which I have done. Of course I've done it. I have done that. I have challenged him to another debate. I have given up my medical records. I did the 60 minutes interview and one has to ask, what is Donald Trump trying to hide? What is his staff and his team trying to keep from you? And it may be the fact that like the people who work closest with him, his chief of staff in the White House, his national security advisor, his secretaries of defense, recently we got the report about General Mark Milley, who all in some have basically said Donald Trump is unfit to be President of the United States and is a danger. And there are many who are believing that all of this points to an individual who is also quite unstable and unfit to be President of the United States. Those are the stakes at play in this election. One more thing I want to ask you before you go and I think it's the fun part. I want to ask you about your plan for black men. Yes. It's something huge that you have just released this week. We're talking about a million, one million loans that are fully forgivable up to $20,000 to black entrepreneurs, men and women, correct? Expanding access to bank accounts, expanding the child tax credit, many things that you're doing. Housing, lowering rent, making it affordable to buy a house for first time home buyers. Talk to me about this plan just in summary and how this will impact not only black men, but all black people. So look, I grew up in the middle class. My mother worked hard. She saved up. And by the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy our first home. I will never forget where I came from. Okay. By the way, my opponent, Donald Trump, was handed $400 million basically on a silver platter and filed for bankruptcy six times. So just keep that in mind about who's coming from where. I know the ambitions, the aspirations, the incredible work ethic that exists in our community. I know the dreams that exist, but not everyone has started out on the same base in terms of being able to realize their goals and their dreams. So my plan is to build what I call an opportunity economy, which means giving people an opportunity to actually achieve those ambitions, those goals and those dreams. So for example, housing is too expensive. The American dream is something that previous generations kind of count on, but no more. So one part of the problem is that we have a supply issue in terms of housing supply. My plan includes working with developers to do what we, and home builders, to create incentives for them to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term. The second part, which is equally important, if not more, is to give people a first time home buyers a $25,000 down payment assistance. Because what you and I know is a lot of folks want to be a homeowner, but they don't come from money. They don't come from some families that can necessarily pass on a home or give them the equity out of their home to help them with the down payment. $25,000 down payment assistance just helps people get their foot in the door to then save up to cover more. $6,000 child tax credit. I'm expanding the child tax credit to $6,000 for young families so that in the first year of their child's life they have the resources they need to buy a crib, a car seat, clothes, knowing that all parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not all parents have the resources to be able to do that. Opportunity. Small businesses. My second mother, our second mother who helped raise us, was a small business owner. I know who our small business owners are. For our communities, they are part of the cultural, economic, civic fabric of our community. They hold the strength of hiring locally, mentoring all that. So I'm going to change so that the tax deduction for a startup small business, change it from what it is, it's $5,000, nobody can start a small business, $5,000 to $50,000, and include in that knowing that a lot of startup businesses then have overhead around, for example, what they need to do to buy equipment for those who are startup and don't have the connections historically, a $20,000 forgivable loan for them to be able, for example, to pay to set up a really good website so that their business could then thrive. Do you think that it might intersect with PPP loans and how some people were involved with that, the PPP loans and fraud and all of that? Fraud. We've done a career prosecuting people for fraud. So we will take care of the abuses. But that's not a reason to not give people an opportunity to thrive. You know, I think there is a real misconception that people just and only their highest aspiration is to have a job. That's not where I come from in terms of how I think of it. The baseline should be everybody has a job. What we should be doing is creating incentives for people to be able to build wealth and build intergenerational wealth. But again, knowing that not everybody starts out on the same base, but when you give them a little bit to just compete, they will work around the clock, good ideas, innovative ideas, and when they have just that little bit extra, it gives them what they need to actually get in there and compete and thrive. That's the theory behind the $20,000 forgivable loan for people at a certain threshold. To just give them the resources, like I said, to start up a website, to buy the equipment they need depending on the kind of business that they're creating so that that's not the barrier to what otherwise is going to be their incredible work ethic and hustle to actually make a success out of their smart idea that actually has relevance to the community. Wow. We are watching. Thank you so much, Vice President Connolly Harris for joining us. It's so important that you're here talking with us. Black media is so important. Of course, always, always.",full,3803

And it's so important to me that over the course of this campaign, we must win. That's our first imperative, no doubt. But that we build up community, right? And coalitions. I think that's so important. One big theme of your campaign has been freedom. Yes. Freedom, right? Yes. Freedom, freedom, I can't live. I'm not going to mess up the words, but I don't want to get sued by Beyonce. And there are a couple of versions that she has, right? So did you call up the queen? Like, how did that work? Well, she absolutely gave me permission to use the song. I love her. And.. Have you met her? I have met her, but not since I've been running just now, but I have met her. And she's just very special. Yeah. Talk about freedom and what that means to you, why that song. It's just imperative. It's crucial right now, what's going on in 2024. I think that there is so much about what is at stake that is, frankly, the need for us to fight for the things that we hold dear, that we have always had to fight for, but must continue to fight for if they're going to be in attack. And frankly, just to be very candid with you, I am seeing across our country a full-on attempt by some to attack these hard-won freedoms and rights, right? The freedom to vote. In Georgia, for example, they passed a law making it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote, which the hypocrisy abounds. Whatever happened to love thy neighbor? You look at the freedom to make decisions for a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.",chunk_2,398
2024-10-14,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with The Shade Room,chunk,"The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. The freedom to just be is under attack in so many places. The freedom to be safe from gun violence, right? And so there is so much about what's at stake in this election that really is about fighting for freedom because the difference between me and my opponent, the former president, Donald Trump, couldn't be more different on so many of these issues. And so I'm so proud and it always just gives me an extra pet because Beyoncé's freedom is my walk on song in all of these rallies. And did you guys share a moment, you and Beyoncé? I mean, you know, what was that conversation like? Well, she and I have, I'll tell you the last time that I saw her was a couple years ago at actually a BT event. And I mean, she's, you know, and her mother, though, I've been seeing a lot of reason because Beyoncé's been on a tour. She's been doing her thing. Tina is so amazing. Woman of the Year, glamour. Yeah. She's very special. She's very special. She's been supporting me for years. And she actually, the last time I talked to her, she was organizing hairstylists and women who have salons and, you know, who are incredible small business owners to get involved around getting out the vote. Speaking of getting out the vote, you guys are on an HBCU tour. Yes, we are. That's amazing. Come on, HU, you know. You know, you know. In fact, I was with a group of incredible distinguished men last night in North Carolina. And we were all, you know, because we, and they were all, you know, there to support my candidacy and to talk about their, their, a lot of them are business owners. But then, you know, we, I'm not going to say we digress, but we definitely got into it about who went to which school. Well, that was my, that's what I was going to ask you. And had a healthy level of disrespect for each other. Well, man, well, this next question might be, you know, a little controversial. So if you didn't go to Howard, is there another school? I can't imagine a world like that.",chunk_3,384
2024-10-14,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with The Shade Room,chunk,"Would you be a spellman? Do you like, would you be a spellman girl? Would you go to Famu? You know, they're very prideful down there in Florida. And they should be. And there was a reason that Howard is called the Mecca. And I'm very proud to be a bison. See, but we all have fun with each other. But you know what? We have fun with each other. Because here's the thing that we know all of us, whether it, I mean, you mentioned all the schools, whether it be spell, spellmen, Famu, all the, the Morehouse, I mean, all, Shaw, all these schools. We have, we have fun banter among us that is absolutely rooted in a collective pride that we share about our HBCU roots, because it is a very special experience. And it is something that gives us a kindred, I think, look on life about, about pride and about the pride in, in the success that we collectively achieve, a knowledge that we collectively stand on very broad shoulders of, of those historic leaders who graduated from each of these schools. And it is actually with that spirit and that sense of family that then we give each other a hard time about which school does what. It's all good fun. It's in good fun. It's good. It's good fun. It's good fun. And obviously we're, we're walking into a week where, you know, you've been talking about really encouraging black men specifically to get out and vote. And I do want to talk about the numbers. I crunched some numbers at three o'clock this morning. Okay. Okay. There was a poll on Saturday. It said that almost 80% of likely black voters would vote for you if the election were held today. In 2020, though, it was 90% of black voters overall. That was from the New York Times and Santa College. And then in 2016, you know, they also had a poll, the Pew Research Center. They said 81% of black men voted for Hillary Clinton, 14% voted for Trump. In 2020, though, that number jumped 6%. So 87% of black men voted for Biden, 12% voted for Trump in 2020. So when you hear those numbers and you're seeing, you know, in the polls and you're seeing black men aren't as, quote, excited or fired up for you, how do you respond to that? Well, that's not my experience.",chunk_4,408
2024-10-14,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with The Shade Room,chunk,"Okay. One, that's not my experience. Two, Election Day has not arrived yet. Okay. And the third point that is probably the most important point is this. You know, when journalists ask me this question, I often will say to them that, you know, let's be clear that your underlying premise is not an assumption that I'm supposed to have black men in my back pocket in terms of their vote and that I should be, I should be taking that for granted because I don't. Black men are no different from anybody else. They expect that you have to earn their vote. And that's why I'm out here doing the work that I'm doing about talking with folks, listening with folks, because I'm running for president in the United States and it is incumbent on me to earn the support. And that is why I'm talking with folks about the work that I have done in my career, whether it be in particular as vice president, what I've done to put more billions of dollars actually into community banks to increase access to capital for small business owners. Even before I was running for president, I convened a bunch of black small business owners, all who were men, and I purposely convened them to, I brought them into my ceremonial office at the White House to have a meeting about what their needs are and to make sure that they have the information about what's available to them in terms of financing capital and access to capital, support for what they want to do in terms of building or growing their business. So that's the kind of work I will continue to do. But here's the other thing that I think is equally important is pointing out that there are two very different visions for our nation that are being presented to voters right now. On the one side you've got Donald Trump, who wants to take us backward. Donald Trump, who let's not forget when he was renting his apartments and his property, refused to rent to black families. Donald Trump, who as it relates to five young black men, they were actually teenagers and Latinos. The Central Park Five, he took out a full page ad in the New York Times calling for their execution.",chunk_5,388
2024-10-14,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with The Shade Room,chunk,"They were innocent. Donald Trump, who referred to the first black president and suggested, remember the birtherism lies, that he couldn't have been born in the United States. Donald Trump, who in his project 2025, you know that the various things that would happen would include allowing it or making it easier for companies to not give workers overtime pay. We cap the cost of prescription medication at $2,000 a year for seniors and cap the cost of insulin at $35 for our seniors. That's our grandparents. Our parents. Black folks are 60% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. His plan would eliminate that cap. So part of the reason that I am out here talking with folks, listening to folks is to make sure that I am communicating and letting them know about the real contrast that is being presented. Because my bottom line is this. I know the power that people have to make a difference. And I respect that power. And I am out here doing the work of earning then the vote so that we can get to the job of continuing to move forward. And for me, that is about pushing for an opportunity economy, which is about tapping into the ambitions and the aspirations of folks and doing the work of investing in community, investing in industries, strengthening our economy, and giving people dignity in the process. Now you have a friend. His name is Barack Hussein Obama. You know him? I do know him. I do. He recently in Pittsburgh. President. President. President. Let's get it right. President Barack Obama. He was campaigning for you in Pittsburgh before some students at the University of Pittsburgh, which is my alma mater. And he said some things that really ruffled some feathers in the news. He said, it makes me think you aren't just feeling the idea of having a woman as a president. You're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that. We have not seen the same kind of energy and turnout in all corners of our neighborhoods and community as we saw when I was running. So when you hear those words, I'm sure you were briefed on the situation.",chunk_6,371
2024-10-14,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with The Shade Room,chunk,"You know, a former Ohio State Senator, Nina Turner, she came out on CNN and said, why are you, you know, putting black men up against the wall and pressuring them into something that possibly, you know, they don't want to do if they want to vote for you or not. So my question to you is, do you think that what President Obama said was the right thing to say? Let me tell you, I am very proud to have the support of President Obama and that he is out traveling to talk with voters about what is at stake in this election. I'm very proud to have his support. What is also important is one, to understand, like as I said, I intend to earn the vote of everyone, including black men. Two, pay attention to everything that President Obama talked about because he also talked about at length the danger of Donald Trump, the danger of Donald Trump in terms of somebody who has said that they would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies, somebody who has referred to black immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, legal immigrants as though they would eat their pets, constantly perpetuating tropes. Remember he who, Donald Trump, who said in Charlottesville, they're good people on each side. So I think it's really important to focus on the stakes of this election and there are two choices, two choices. And I ask everyone to look at the background, look at the work, look at the words to have a sense of how you then choose to use the power of your vote on election day. But there is a very big difference between Donald Trump and how I will be President of the United States and I cannot impress upon people enough that this is somebody, Donald Trump, who intends to take us backward. Look, this man won't even debate me a second time. He won't even debate me a second time. He didn't do the 60 minutes interview, which I believe every presidential candidate for President of the United States has done. He will not take up the important responsibility that every presidential candidate has done of showing their medical records.",chunk_7,371
2024-10-14,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with The Shade Room,chunk,"Okay? Which I have done. Of course I've done it. I have done that. I have challenged him to another debate. I have given up my medical records. I did the 60 minutes interview and one has to ask, what is Donald Trump trying to hide? What is his staff and his team trying to keep from you? And it may be the fact that like the people who work closest with him, his chief of staff in the White House, his national security advisor, his secretaries of defense, recently we got the report about General Mark Milley, who all in some have basically said Donald Trump is unfit to be President of the United States and is a danger. And there are many who are believing that all of this points to an individual who is also quite unstable and unfit to be President of the United States. Those are the stakes at play in this election. One more thing I want to ask you before you go and I think it's the fun part. I want to ask you about your plan for black men. Yes. It's something huge that you have just released this week. We're talking about a million, one million loans that are fully forgivable up to $20,000 to black entrepreneurs, men and women, correct? Expanding access to bank accounts, expanding the child tax credit, many things that you're doing. Housing, lowering rent, making it affordable to buy a house for first time home buyers. Talk to me about this plan just in summary and how this will impact not only black men, but all black people. So look, I grew up in the middle class. My mother worked hard. She saved up. And by the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy our first home. I will never forget where I came from. Okay. By the way, my opponent, Donald Trump, was handed $400 million basically on a silver platter and filed for bankruptcy six times. So just keep that in mind about who's coming from where. I know the ambitions, the aspirations, the incredible work ethic that exists in our community. I know the dreams that exist, but not everyone has started out on the same base in terms of being able to realize their goals and their dreams.",chunk_8,389
2024-10-14,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with The Shade Room,chunk,"So my plan is to build what I call an opportunity economy, which means giving people an opportunity to actually achieve those ambitions, those goals and those dreams. So for example, housing is too expensive. The American dream is something that previous generations kind of count on, but no more. So one part of the problem is that we have a supply issue in terms of housing supply. My plan includes working with developers to do what we, and home builders, to create incentives for them to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term. The second part, which is equally important, if not more, is to give people a first time home buyers a $25,000 down payment assistance. Because what you and I know is a lot of folks want to be a homeowner, but they don't come from money. They don't come from some families that can necessarily pass on a home or give them the equity out of their home to help them with the down payment. $25,000 down payment assistance just helps people get their foot in the door to then save up to cover more. $6,000 child tax credit. I'm expanding the child tax credit to $6,000 for young families so that in the first year of their child's life they have the resources they need to buy a crib, a car seat, clothes, knowing that all parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not all parents have the resources to be able to do that. Opportunity. Small businesses. My second mother, our second mother who helped raise us, was a small business owner. I know who our small business owners are. For our communities, they are part of the cultural, economic, civic fabric of our community. They hold the strength of hiring locally, mentoring all that. So I'm going to change so that the tax deduction for a startup small business, change it from what it is, it's $5,000, nobody can start a small business, $5,000 to $50,000, and include in that knowing that a lot of startup businesses then have overhead around, for example, what they need to do to buy equipment for those who are startup and don't have the connections historically, a $20,000 forgivable loan for them to be able, for example, to pay to set up a really good website so that their business could then thrive.",chunk_9,405
2024-10-14,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with The Shade Room,chunk,"Do you think that it might intersect with PPP loans and how some people were involved with that, the PPP loans and fraud and all of that? Fraud. We've done a career prosecuting people for fraud. So we will take care of the abuses. But that's not a reason to not give people an opportunity to thrive. You know, I think there is a real misconception that people just and only their highest aspiration is to have a job. That's not where I come from in terms of how I think of it. The baseline should be everybody has a job. What we should be doing is creating incentives for people to be able to build wealth and build intergenerational wealth. But again, knowing that not everybody starts out on the same base, but when you give them a little bit to just compete, they will work around the clock, good ideas, innovative ideas, and when they have just that little bit extra, it gives them what they need to actually get in there and compete and thrive. That's the theory behind the $20,000 forgivable loan for people at a certain threshold. To just give them the resources, like I said, to start up a website, to buy the equipment they need depending on the kind of business that they're creating so that that's not the barrier to what otherwise is going to be their incredible work ethic and hustle to actually make a success out of their smart idea that actually has relevance to the community. Wow. We are watching. Thank you so much, Vice President Connolly Harris for joining us. It's so important that you're here talking with us. Black media is so important. Of course, always, always.",chunk_10,290
2024-10-16,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania with former U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger",full,"Hello everybody. I am former Republican Congressman Jim Greenwood. I want to welcome you all to Washington Crossing, Bucks County. This is the place where on Christmas Day in 1776, George Washington and 2400 American Patriots crossed the treacherously ice-filled Delaware River back there in a blinding snowstorm and marched 10 miles to Trenton to launch a surprise attack on the Hessian garrison. It was the Continental Army's first major victory of the war and a much needed boost to the morale, inspiring more men to join the Continental Army and enabling the creation of the greatest democracy the world has ever known. So we are here today because we know that whether the United States of America will remain the world's greatest democracy now depends on whether the world's greatest democracy will elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States of America. Now I have had the honor to represent this community in the Pennsylvania House and Senate for 12 years and the US Congress for 12 years. I am a lifelong Republican. I noticed when I put my socks on they have elephants on them this morning. And I have supported every Republican nominee for president from Richard Nixon to Mitt Romney. And then along came Donald Trump. For me, as I think it should be for every American, the first threshold for supporting a candidate for public office is not party or policy, but fitness for office. And Donald Trump is utterly and unequivocally unfit for office. Now, I am not a psychiatrist, but I have listened to psychiatrists and they say that Donald Trump is a malignant narcissist and a pathological liar. Even George Santos couldn't keep up with him. Trump cares only about himself and his ambition. He has lied about losing the 2020 election for four years. He summoned his mob to Washington on January 6th and he sat in the White House watching on television as his thugs brutalized law enforcement officers and threatened members of Congress and the vice president for three hours and he did nothing to stop the carnage. Nothing could undermine our democracy more than for hundreds of millions of Americans to believe that our elections are rigged. Never in American history has so many cabinet members, chiefs of staff, military leaders, close associates, and even the vice president himself judged a president to be so dangerous and unfit for office. Now, I am proud to chair Pennsylvania Republicans for Harris-Waltz. And I do so along with my co-chair, Ann Womble, the former chair of the Republican Committee of Lancaster County. Are you here somewhere, Ann? She's probably out canvassing or something. We are not supporting Kamala Harris only because Trump is so grotesquely unfit for office. We support Kamala Harris because she is everything Donald Trump is not. For all of her career, she's been an honest, honorable, and ethical public servant. Kamala Harris is a protector of women and of men and of children. She is authentic, compassionate, serious, wise, and good. She's smarter than Trump, stronger than Trump, tougher than Trump, and a much better dancer than Trump. Republicans and independents across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and across America are choosing country over party to ensure Donald Trump never steps foot inside the Oval Office again. We're traveling the Commonwealth to mobilize Republican voters and make sure they understand the gravity and the stakes in this election. We want a president with common sense and decency, and that is Kamala Harris. As the vice president often says herself, it's clear we have so much more in common as Americans than what separates us. Standing up for our neighbors, hope for our future, love of country. Pennsylvania is the birthplace of American democracy, and the keystone state will be key to preserving our democracy. We cannot, we will not allow Donald Trump to destroy our democracy, and we will proudly elect Kamala Harris, president of our nation. We Republicans in Pennsylvania are not alone. More than 30 former Republican members of Congress have joined to put country first and endorse Kamala Harris. Several are with us today, and it is my pleasure to recognize former Republican members of Congress, Mickey Edwards of California, Barbara Comstack of Virginia, Joe Walsh of Illinois, Chris Shays of Connecticut, Charles Dejeu of Hawaii, and John LeBoudlais of New York, and Denver Riggleman of Virginia, and David Trott of Michigan, and a real American hero from whom we will soon hear Adam Kinziger. Never clap, the wind's blowing. Others will soon announce their support, and there are many other former Republican members of Congress who have told us that they do not support Kamala, and they will vote, I mean Trump, and they will vote for President Harris, but fear so saying publicly, and that is a shame. So with that, I'm going to wait for the introduction of another real American hero, Jeff Duncan. Please welcome former Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan. Good afternoon. It's great to be back in the Keystone State. Little kept secret, this is actually the state I was born in in western Pennsylvania, so I've been spending a lot of time visiting relatives back in the Keystone State. So why in the world is a former Republican Lieutenant Governor from Georgia in Pennsylvania campaigning for a Democratic candidate for President Kamala Harris? It's a very, very simple answer for me, because I care more about the future of this country than I care about the future of Donald Trump. If us Republicans are being intellectually honest with each other, we wouldn't trust Donald Trump to run a lemonade stand, and almost everyone who's ever gotten close to Donald Trump has regretted it. Friends, business partners, cabinet members, former White House staff, generals, everybody seems to regret it. This guy is the ultimate boat anchor around Republicans next, and we know it. This election no doubt is going to be close, and every vote is going to count, especially right here in Pennsylvania, and especially amongst the patriotic Republicans that are willing to put country over party. Let me take a second to set some perspective on how important this election actually is. The future of a free and sovereign Ukraine is on the ballot in November. The future of NATO is on the ballot in November. Whether or not every family in America pays $4,000 in an annual Trump tax increase is on the ballot in November. And last but not least, the future of our country's delicate democracy is on the ballot in November. Us levelheader Republicans are sick and tired of making excuses for Donald Trump everywhere we go, church, neighborhoods, even at our own kitchen tables. It's time for us common sense Republicans to do a little house cleaning and dump Donald Trump. I get asked this question all the time, is it enough for me just to not vote for Donald Trump if I'm a Republican? Can I just skip them on the ballot? And my answer is no, that simply just makes a point that you don't like Donald Trump. We need to make a difference and beat Donald Trump. If you're a Republican and you vote for Kamala Harris in 2024, it doesn't make you a Democrat, it simply makes you a patriot. I've got three great reasons why a Republican should vote for Kamala Harris. First, Donald Trump's been a fake Republican for eight years. He spent eight trillion dollars we didn't have just to simply buy votes. He botched COVID from top to bottom. He'd only built 2% of a border wall that he promised he would build. And worst of all, he became best friends with Vladimir Putin. Donald Trump is the original Rhino in my book. Second of all, Donald Trump is a direct threat to democracy. I had a front row seat in Georgia and watched his willingness to lie, cheat, and steal to try to stay in power in 2020. There's nothing he's not willing to do or say to remain in power, including the tragic events on January 6th. It's important to recognize that he continues to be a threat to democracy. With all the seeds of doubt, he continues to plant around our country. He will be recognized in history as a wannabe dictator, not a former president. Third and most importantly, Kamala Harris will be a better president of the United States than Donald Trump ever will be. She will be the steady hand that this country so desperately needs. She will bring her prosecutor mindset to the Oval Office and be able to see the difference between good and evil. Kamala Harris will continue to focus on the middle class, not pander to them like Donald Trump does. Nothing says middle class more than a small business, whether you own it or work for it. And her dedication to a $50,000 startup tax deduction is huge and will be a catalyst for the American dream for families all over our country. Here's the biggest reason why we should support Kamala Harris as Republicans, because we will never go to bed worrying about where she stands on democracy. We will never go to bed worrying about where she stands on democracy every time we go to bed with Donald Trump in the Oval Office. We should all be concerned about our democracy. We might disagree with her policies, but we will not disagree on democracy. Now look, let's just talk one on one here. Nobody likes hanging out with a liar, right? The last thing you want is a liar is a neighbor, a business partner, you especially don't want a liar as a spouse. We certainly don't want a liar as the president. In our family, we've got a motto, doing the right thing will never be the wrong thing. And so I encourage all my Republican friends, you know the right thing to do. Now have the courage to vote for Kamala Harris in November. It's my honor now to bring to the stage a great friend of mine that's on the same journey who's willing to put country over party, Olivia Troy, former Homeland Security Advisor to Vice President Mike Pence. Thank you and God bless the great state of Pennsylvania. Please welcome former Homeland Security Advisor, Olivia Troy. Thank you. It's great to be with you all today. I actually went to college in Pennsylvania, so it's so great to be back in this beautiful state. So I know you know this, I'm Olivia Troy, I'm a lifelong Republican. I started my career at the Republican National Committee. I served under George W. Bush and then I served as a national security official under Donald Trump. As an official in Trump's administration, I witnessed firsthand his disregard for the American people and his disregard to the rule of law. I had a front row seat to the damage Trump created in his first term and I can confidently and without any hesitation say that he is too dangerous to get anywhere near the Oval Office again. Trump has never cared about making our country safer and I want to be clear that it pains me to say this about someone who served as president of the United States because like many of my colleagues and fellow Americans, I hold the office of the president in very high regard. Donald Trump's North Star is Donald Trump and we saw that when he killed the toughest bipartisan border bill in decades all because he wanted to run on a problem instead of fixing it. That bill which Vice President Kamala Harris supports would have hired more border agents delivered new resources to stop the flow of fentanyl and solved a problem. But Donald Trump stepped in and he stopped it and it's tracks so that he could use it for his own political benefit. He doesn't care about solutions. He cares about power. Power over our daily lives. Power over our future. Power over women. Trump even went as far as saying recently that he'll protect women. Yeah, let me be clear those are his words not mine because I would never in a million years call Trump a protector let alone a protector of women. Do you know many of the women who've been around Donald Trump would agree with me? We all have our own stories and you know what else? American women agree with me because we've watched him rip away our reproductive freedom and we've heard him brag about it over and over again ever since. What's more? We know that it's devastating as Trump's legacy is a second term would be far worse. Trump's project 2025 agenda would ban abortion in every state with or without the help of Congress. It would restrict access to contraception and threaten IVF. So while Trump runs around telling women he'll be our protector, we know the truth. He won't protect our democracy. He won't protect our economy. And he certainly won't protect our healthcare. And he sure as hell won't protect our freedoms. We need a leader who wants to solve problems who will work across the aisle and get things done for the American people. That's why as a lifelong Republican I'll be casting my ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris. I don't have to agree with everything but I know that she will protect our democracy and our fundamental freedoms. She'll be a president for all Americans. Donald Trump will be a president for one person and one person only. Himself. So I thank you all for being here today. Thank you for being part of this growing coalition. It's together that we're going to stand together. They don't get to bully us. They don't get to intimidate us. There are more of us than them. Remember this. Hey, what's going on? What a beautiful day. Good afternoon, everybody. How are you? Excellent. Excellent. Well, look, I'm Adam Kinzinger. I'm a Republican and I am proud to be with you here today. You know, the last four years I've taken stands that have put me on the outside of the party. Some have questioned why I've taken the stands that I have and the answer is really simple because we must put country first. We must put our country over our party and like you, I'm putting my country first. And I thank you for being here. You know, as a young man, what drew me to the Republican Party was its ideals of supporting democracy, of standing for the rule of law, and of honoring the Hollywood document that our founding fathers signed right here in this great state, the Constitution of the United States. And as a military guy, I've always respected strength in leadership and Trump is the opposite of that. He's a whiny, weak, small, tiny man who is scared to death. You know, Donald Trump may be running as a Republican, but the truth is he does not share those long held Republican values of supporting democracy, of standing for the rule of law, and of faithfulness to the Constitution. As a Republican, that saddens me. But what gives me hope is that there is a candidate in this race who does hold those values. You know, I know that Kamala Harris shares my allegiance to the rule of law, to the Constitution, and to democracy. Whatever policies we disagree on, pale in comparison to those fundamental matters of principle, of decency, of fidelity to this nation. You know, democracy knows no party. Democracy is a living, breathing ideal that defines us as a nation. It's the bedrock that separates us from tyranny. And when that foundation is fractured, we must stand united to strengthen it. And I, like you, believe that those values are worth defending. And if you think those principles are worth defending, I urge you to make the conservative choice, vote for our bedrock values, and vote for Kamala Harris. God bless you. Thank you. Please welcome Bob and Chris. Hello, everyone. My name is Bob Lang. And my name is Christina Lang. Christina and I live on our family farm that's been in my family since 1896. Five generations have called that place home. We have been Republicans all our lives. We both voted for Donald Trump. I voted for him twice. It made sense. We are Republicans. You vote for the Republican candidate. I should make a note. Christina was ahead of the learning curve. She only voted for him once. I thought he'd fight for people like us, but it's clear Donald Trump doesn't care about helping hardworking people. And he certainly doesn't care about our commonwealth and our Constitution. He only cares about what's good for him. January 6th was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I watched in horror as what went down. The guy encouraged a violent mob to storm the Capitol, then sat back and did nothing, and attempted to overturn a free and fair election. Just this week, he called for the unleashing of US military on American citizens who he called the enemy within. That is dangerous language. We know that a second Trump term would be much worse than his first. And we deserve better. We deserve a leader who will bring people together and fight for the middle class, not someone who tries to divide us. We also need someone who actually cares about the American people and who will defend our Constitution. And that's why Bob and I are both voting for Kamala Harris. Never in a million years did either of us think that we'd be standing here supporting a Democrat. But we've had enough. We've had enough. And we've also noticed that Kamala is an amazing candidate in so many ways. But it's time to turn the page on Trump and his chaos and the way he divides us as people in this nation. We've got to move forward. We've got to elect someone who is in this fight for the working class people. And not trying to help her rich friends get richer. Or taking revenge on people that have slighted her in any way. We've got to elect someone who will take our commonwealth forward and not backwards. There's more at stake in this election than any other election in my lifetime. And the choice for us and millions of Republicans across the country is simple. It's Kamala Harris. She's charting a new way forward. Forward where costs are lower for folks like us and you. And where our democracy and freedoms are a priority and are protected. And now we are so incredibly honored to introduce our incredible leader. Please join us in welcoming the next president of the United States Vice President Kamala Harris. Pennsylvania. Good afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. Bob and Christina. Thank you so very much for that introduction and for your friendship. And as I've said to all the friends and leaders on the stage with me, we had a chance to speak ahead of time. I thank you all for everything that you are doing and the courage you are showing. You know this is an extraordinary climate right now. And I think we all recognize the courage that you are each showing to speak out so publicly and to put as we are saying because we truly believe a country over power. So thank you all. Can we please applaud Bob and Christina and all of the folks on the stage please. Thank you. Thank you. So if you all have a seat please do sit. Yes. So as I think everyone here knows, we meet in a place that holds a very special meaning for our country. Here on Christmas night, 1776, General George Washington and over 2000 troops crossed the icy Delaware River in darkness. Then marched to Trenton where they surprised an outpost of enemy soldiers and achieved a major victory in the American Revolution. And after we won the war and achieved our independence, delegates from across the nation gathered not far from here in Philadelphia to write and to sign the Constitution of the United States. And we remember and reflect on what that moment was. Knowing that leading up to that, that work to write, to compose the Constitution of the United States, that work was not easy. The founders often disagreed, often quite passionately. But in the end, the Constitution of the United States laid out the foundations of our democracy, including the rule of law, that there would be checks and balances, that we would have free and fair elections, and a peaceful transfer of power. And these principles and traditions have sustained our nation for over two centuries. Sustained because generations of Americans from all backgrounds, from all beliefs, have cherished them, upheld them, and defended them. And now the baton is in our hands. So I am joined today by over 100 Republican leaders from across Pennsylvania and across our country who are supporting my candidacy for president of the United States. And I am deeply honored to have their support. Some served in state houses, some in the United States Congress, some worked for other Republican presidents and presidential nominees, including Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan. And some today served in Donald Trump's own administration. We also have with us Republican voters from here in Pennsylvania and beyond who have been active in their Republican parties for years, who have supported Republican candidates up and down the ticket. Now, I say all that to make an obvious point. In a typical election year, you all being here with me might be a bit surprising, dare I say unusual. But not in this election. Not in this election. Because at stake in this race are the Democratic ideals that our founders and generations of Americans before us have fought for. At stake in this election is the Constitution of the United States, it very self. We are here today because we share a core belief that we must put country before party. We chant that with such great pride because we all know we all have so much more in common than what separates us. And at some point in the career of the folks who joined me on stage, one of the other things that we have in common is in our careers, we have each sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States. And so we know that sacred oath must always be honored and never violated. And that we should expect anyone who seeks the highest office in our land would meet that standard. We here know the Constitution is not a relic from our past, but determines whether we are a country where the people can speak freely and even criticize the president without fear of being thrown in jail or targeted by the military. Where the people can worship as they choose without the government interfering. Where you can vote without fear that your vote will be thrown away. All of this and more depends on whether or not our leaders honor their oaths to the Constitution. I have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution six times, including as Vice President, as the United States Senator, and as the top law enforcement officer of the largest state in our country. And I have never wavered from upholding that oath. And this is a profound difference between Donald Trump and me. He who violated the oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and make no mistake, he who, if given the chance, will violate it again. Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. And he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of a free and fair election. He sent a mob, an armed mob, to the United States Capitol where they violently assaulted police officers, law enforcement officials, and threatened the life of his own vice president. And he refused to engage in the peaceful transfer of power. Were it not for the courage and patriotism of Vice President Pence that day, Donald Trump might have actually succeeded in overturning the will of the American people. Let's reflect on that. And now, Donald Trump is telling us how he intends to use power if he is elected again. He has stated that one of the biggest threats America faces is, quote, the enemy from within. The enemy from within. But nowhere that language harkens back to. Understand and let us be clear about what he is saying. He considers any American who doesn't support him or bend to his will to be an enemy to our country. And further, he says that as commander in chief, he would use our military to go after them. Honestly, let that sink in. Use of the American military? To go after American citizens? And we know who he would target first, because he has targeted them and attacked them before. Journalists whose stories he doesn't like. Nonpartisan election officials who refused to cheat by finding extra votes for him. Judges who insist on following the law instead of following him. It is clear Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged. And he is seeking unchecked power. Consider what his closest advisors have said. His national security advisor, two defense secretaries, his former chief of staff, his own vice president. All have warned America Donald Trump is unfit to serve. Or listen to General Milley. Donald Trump's top general. He has called Trump, and I quote, fascist to the core. And said, quote, no one has ever been as dangerous to this country. So think about that. General Milley served in uniform for more than 40 years, commanding American forces around the world. He has confronted some of America's worst enemies. And he is saying no one has ever been as dangerous to our country as Donald Trump. America must heed this warning because anyone who tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has, anyone who has called for the quote termination of the Constitution of the United States as Donald Trump has, must never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. Never again. And to those, and to those who are watching, if you share that view, no matter your party, no matter who you voted for last time, there is a place for you in this campaign. The coalition we have built was ready to turn the page on the chaos and instability of Donald Trump. And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans. And I take that pledge seriously. I take that pledge quite seriously. So as I've mentioned, many of you know, I spent a career as a prosecutor in law enforcement, and I will tell you, I never asked a victim or a witness, are you a Republican or are you a Democrat? I never asked of anyone who needed help. If anyone who deserved attention, where were they registered and who did they vote for? The only question I ever asked was, are you okay? And that is the kind of president I pledge to you that I will be. That is my pledge to you. Because we have too much to do and too much good work to do to be relegated, to requiring each of us to be in some silo disconnected from each other. There's too much good to be done. And the challenges that we face as a nation require us, if we truly want, to create solutions and strengthen our nation. The approach truly requires that we understand we're all in this together. This is so much more than rhetoric or a campaign. It really is about tapping into the spirit of who we are as Americans. Because we are all in this together. We are all in this together. And so I pledge to be a president who actively works to unite us around our highest aspirations. I pledge to be you, to be a president who is realistic and practical and has common sense and to always fight for the American people. Unlike Donald Trump, who frankly as we have seen, cares more about running on problems than fixing problems. I want to fix problems, which means working across the aisle. It requires working across the aisle. It requires embracing good ideas from wherever they come. That is why I have pledged to appoint a Republican in my cabinet. That is why I have pledged to establish a council on bipartisan solutions to recommend to me common sense solutions to some of the most pressing issues facing our country. Because nobody has a corner on the good ideas. They actually come from many places and one should, especially if they want to be a leader, one should welcome those ideas. And those ideas, which are about in particular strengthening the middle class, securing our border, defending our freedoms, and maintaining our leadership in the world. And all of this is to also say that I believe for America to be the world's strongest democracy, we must have a healthy two-party system. Because it is when we have a healthy two-party system that leaders are then required to debate the merits of policy and to work yes across the aisle regularly and routinely to get things done. And I have experienced firsthand how important and rewarding that kind of bipartisan cooperation can be. So I'll tell you, when I was the United States Senator, I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee. It was actually my favorite committee for a number of reasons, but specifically this. There we dealt with some of the most pressing issues affecting national security. There we would talk about hot spots around the world and what we needed to do to focus on keeping America safe and secure. And to do that, we would review classified information which required us to meet in a secure room. Adam, you know, it's called a skiff. Okay. When we would go in that room, with all due respect, no cameras were allowed. No press. And we would roll up our sleeves and get to work. I'm telling you, senators of both parties would walk in that room, take off their suit jackets, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table. And we would have real conversations. Real conversations. As Americans. Because we understood that what happened in that room, well, the stakes were so high. And therefore, it could not be, we could not afford to let it be about whether one was a Democrat or a Republican. The stakes were too high. We were in that room and it was all about us as Americans. About doing what is in the best interest of the safety and security of our nation. I love that work. And it was what we have is the theme of today. It was country over party in action. In action. So I know it can be done. And that is the standard of leadership and the aspiration that I have in terms of how we will work when with your help, I am elected president of the United States. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So we got to get to work. We got to get to work. So let me just say an obvious point. There's a fundamental choice in this election, a very fundamental choice. A choice between the leadership that I pledged to offer to America, leadership that brings folks together that builds consensus and focuses on making life better for you with the knowledge that we have so much more in common than what separates us. And on the other hand, the choice of someone who I think we can guarantee will sit in the Oval Office plotting retribution, stew in his own grievances and think only about himself and not you. So as I have said, our campaign is not a fight against something. It is a fight for something. It is a fight for the fundamental principles upon which we were founded. It is a fight for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can achieve together, Republicans, Democrats and independents who want to move past the politics of division and blame and get things done on behalf of the American people. And when it all comes down to it, I know we are all here together this beautiful afternoon because we love our country. We love our country. And we are here because we know the deep privilege and pride that comes with being an American and the duty that comes along with it and the duty that comes along with it. Imperfect though we may be, America is still that shining city upon a hill that inspires people around the world. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. So to people from across Pennsylvania and across our nation, let us together stand up for the rule of law, for our democratic ideals and for the constitution of the United States. And in 20 days, we have the power to chart a new way forward. One that is worthy of this magnificent country that we are all blessed to call home. Thank you all. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",full,5647
2024-10-16,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania with former U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger",chunk,"Hello everybody. I am former Republican Congressman Jim Greenwood. I want to welcome you all to Washington Crossing, Bucks County. This is the place where on Christmas Day in 1776, George Washington and 2400 American Patriots crossed the treacherously ice-filled Delaware River back there in a blinding snowstorm and marched 10 miles to Trenton to launch a surprise attack on the Hessian garrison. It was the Continental Army's first major victory of the war and a much needed boost to the morale, inspiring more men to join the Continental Army and enabling the creation of the greatest democracy the world has ever known. So we are here today because we know that whether the United States of America will remain the world's greatest democracy now depends on whether the world's greatest democracy will elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States of America. Now I have had the honor to represent this community in the Pennsylvania House and Senate for 12 years and the US Congress for 12 years. I am a lifelong Republican. I noticed when I put my socks on they have elephants on them this morning. And I have supported every Republican nominee for president from Richard Nixon to Mitt Romney. And then along came Donald Trump. For me, as I think it should be for every American, the first threshold for supporting a candidate for public office is not party or policy, but fitness for office. And Donald Trump is utterly and unequivocally unfit for office. Now, I am not a psychiatrist, but I have listened to psychiatrists and they say that Donald Trump is a malignant narcissist and a pathological liar. Even George Santos couldn't keep up with him. Trump cares only about himself and his ambition. He has lied about losing the 2020 election for four years. He summoned his mob to Washington on January 6th and he sat in the White House watching on television as his thugs brutalized law enforcement officers and threatened members of Congress and the vice president for three hours and he did nothing to stop the carnage.",chunk_1,352

Adam Kinzinger",chunk,"Nothing could undermine our democracy more than for hundreds of millions of Americans to believe that our elections are rigged. Never in American history has so many cabinet members, chiefs of staff, military leaders, close associates, and even the vice president himself judged a president to be so dangerous and unfit for office. Now, I am proud to chair Pennsylvania Republicans for Harris-Waltz. And I do so along with my co-chair, Ann Womble, the former chair of the Republican Committee of Lancaster County. Are you here somewhere, Ann? She's probably out canvassing or something. We are not supporting Kamala Harris only because Trump is so grotesquely unfit for office. We support Kamala Harris because she is everything Donald Trump is not. For all of her career, she's been an honest, honorable, and ethical public servant. Kamala Harris is a protector of women and of men and of children. She is authentic, compassionate, serious, wise, and good. She's smarter than Trump, stronger than Trump, tougher than Trump, and a much better dancer than Trump. Republicans and independents across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and across America are choosing country over party to ensure Donald Trump never steps foot inside the Oval Office again. We're traveling the Commonwealth to mobilize Republican voters and make sure they understand the gravity and the stakes in this election. We want a president with common sense and decency, and that is Kamala Harris. As the vice president often says herself, it's clear we have so much more in common as Americans than what separates us. Standing up for our neighbors, hope for our future, love of country. Pennsylvania is the birthplace of American democracy, and the keystone state will be key to preserving our democracy. We cannot, we will not allow Donald Trump to destroy our democracy, and we will proudly elect Kamala Harris, president of our nation. We Republicans in Pennsylvania are not alone. More than 30 former Republican members of Congress have joined to put country first and endorse Kamala Harris.",chunk_2,336
2024-10-16,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania with former U.S. Rep.

Never clap, the wind's blowing. Others will soon announce their support, and there are many other former Republican members of Congress who have told us that they do not support Kamala, and they will vote, I mean Trump, and they will vote for President Harris, but fear so saying publicly, and that is a shame. So with that, I'm going to wait for the introduction of another real American hero, Jeff Duncan. Please welcome former Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan. Good afternoon. It's great to be back in the Keystone State. Little kept secret, this is actually the state I was born in in western Pennsylvania, so I've been spending a lot of time visiting relatives back in the Keystone State. So why in the world is a former Republican Lieutenant Governor from Georgia in Pennsylvania campaigning for a Democratic candidate for President Kamala Harris? It's a very, very simple answer for me, because I care more about the future of this country than I care about the future of Donald Trump. If us Republicans are being intellectually honest with each other, we wouldn't trust Donald Trump to run a lemonade stand, and almost everyone who's ever gotten close to Donald Trump has regretted it. Friends, business partners, cabinet members, former White House staff, generals, everybody seems to regret it. This guy is the ultimate boat anchor around Republicans next, and we know it. This election no doubt is going to be close, and every vote is going to count, especially right here in Pennsylvania, and especially amongst the patriotic Republicans that are willing to put country over party. Let me take a second to set some perspective on how important this election actually is.",chunk_3,350
2024-10-16,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania with former U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger",chunk,"The future of a free and sovereign Ukraine is on the ballot in November. The future of NATO is on the ballot in November. Whether or not every family in America pays $4,000 in an annual Trump tax increase is on the ballot in November. And last but not least, the future of our country's delicate democracy is on the ballot in November. Us levelheader Republicans are sick and tired of making excuses for Donald Trump everywhere we go, church, neighborhoods, even at our own kitchen tables. It's time for us common sense Republicans to do a little house cleaning and dump Donald Trump. I get asked this question all the time, is it enough for me just to not vote for Donald Trump if I'm a Republican? Can I just skip them on the ballot? And my answer is no, that simply just makes a point that you don't like Donald Trump. We need to make a difference and beat Donald Trump. If you're a Republican and you vote for Kamala Harris in 2024, it doesn't make you a Democrat, it simply makes you a patriot. I've got three great reasons why a Republican should vote for Kamala Harris. First, Donald Trump's been a fake Republican for eight years. He spent eight trillion dollars we didn't have just to simply buy votes. He botched COVID from top to bottom. He'd only built 2% of a border wall that he promised he would build. And worst of all, he became best friends with Vladimir Putin. Donald Trump is the original Rhino in my book. Second of all, Donald Trump is a direct threat to democracy. I had a front row seat in Georgia and watched his willingness to lie, cheat, and steal to try to stay in power in 2020. There's nothing he's not willing to do or say to remain in power, including the tragic events on January 6th. It's important to recognize that he continues to be a threat to democracy. With all the seeds of doubt, he continues to plant around our country. He will be recognized in history as a wannabe dictator, not a former president. Third and most importantly, Kamala Harris will be a better president of the United States than Donald Trump ever will be.",chunk_4,381
2024-10-16,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania with former U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger",chunk,"She will be the steady hand that this country so desperately needs. She will bring her prosecutor mindset to the Oval Office and be able to see the difference between good and evil. Kamala Harris will continue to focus on the middle class, not pander to them like Donald Trump does. Nothing says middle class more than a small business, whether you own it or work for it. And her dedication to a $50,000 startup tax deduction is huge and will be a catalyst for the American dream for families all over our country. Here's the biggest reason why we should support Kamala Harris as Republicans, because we will never go to bed worrying about where she stands on democracy. We will never go to bed worrying about where she stands on democracy every time we go to bed with Donald Trump in the Oval Office. We should all be concerned about our democracy. We might disagree with her policies, but we will not disagree on democracy. Now look, let's just talk one on one here. Nobody likes hanging out with a liar, right? The last thing you want is a liar is a neighbor, a business partner, you especially don't want a liar as a spouse. We certainly don't want a liar as the president. In our family, we've got a motto, doing the right thing will never be the wrong thing. And so I encourage all my Republican friends, you know the right thing to do. Now have the courage to vote for Kamala Harris in November. It's my honor now to bring to the stage a great friend of mine that's on the same journey who's willing to put country over party, Olivia Troy, former Homeland Security Advisor to Vice President Mike Pence. Thank you and God bless the great state of Pennsylvania. Please welcome former Homeland Security Advisor, Olivia Troy. Thank you. It's great to be with you all today. I actually went to college in Pennsylvania, so it's so great to be back in this beautiful state. So I know you know this, I'm Olivia Troy, I'm a lifelong Republican.

2024-10-16,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania with former U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger",chunk,"Bush and then I served as a national security official under Donald Trump. As an official in Trump's administration, I witnessed firsthand his disregard for the American people and his disregard to the rule of law. I had a front row seat to the damage Trump created in his first term and I can confidently and without any hesitation say that he is too dangerous to get anywhere near the Oval Office again. Trump has never cared about making our country safer and I want to be clear that it pains me to say this about someone who served as president of the United States because like many of my colleagues and fellow Americans, I hold the office of the president in very high regard. Donald Trump's North Star is Donald Trump and we saw that when he killed the toughest bipartisan border bill in decades all because he wanted to run on a problem instead of fixing it. That bill which Vice President Kamala Harris supports would have hired more border agents delivered new resources to stop the flow of fentanyl and solved a problem. But Donald Trump stepped in and he stopped it and it's tracks so that he could use it for his own political benefit. He doesn't care about solutions. He cares about power. Power over our daily lives. Power over our future. Power over women. Trump even went as far as saying recently that he'll protect women. Yeah, let me be clear those are his words not mine because I would never in a million years call Trump a protector let alone a protector of women. Do you know many of the women who've been around Donald Trump would agree with me? We all have our own stories and you know what else? American women agree with me because we've watched him rip away our reproductive freedom and we've heard him brag about it over and over again ever since. What's more? We know that it's devastating as Trump's legacy is a second term would be far worse. Trump's project 2025 agenda would ban abortion in every state with or without the help of Congress. It would restrict access to contraception and threaten IVF.",chunk_6,369

And he certainly won't protect our healthcare. And he sure as hell won't protect our freedoms. We need a leader who wants to solve problems who will work across the aisle and get things done for the American people. That's why as a lifelong Republican I'll be casting my ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris. I don't have to agree with everything but I know that she will protect our democracy and our fundamental freedoms. She'll be a president for all Americans. Donald Trump will be a president for one person and one person only. Himself. So I thank you all for being here today. Thank you for being part of this growing coalition.

You know, the last four years I've taken stands that have put me on the outside of the party. Some have questioned why I've taken the stands that I have and the answer is really simple because we must put country first. We must put our country over our party and like you, I'm putting my country first. And I thank you for being here. You know, as a young man, what drew me to the Republican Party was its ideals of supporting democracy, of standing for the rule of law, and of honoring the Hollywood document that our founding fathers signed right here in this great state, the Constitution of the United States. And as a military guy, I've always respected strength in leadership and Trump is the opposite of that. He's a whiny, weak, small, tiny man who is scared to death.

So as I think everyone here knows, we meet in a place that holds a very special meaning for our country. Here on Christmas night, 1776, General George Washington and over 2000 troops crossed the icy Delaware River in darkness. Then marched to Trenton where they surprised an outpost of enemy soldiers and achieved a major victory in the American Revolution. And after we won the war and achieved our independence, delegates from across the nation gathered not far from here in Philadelphia to write and to sign the Constitution of the United States. And we remember and reflect on what that moment was. Knowing that leading up to that, that work to write, to compose the Constitution of the United States, that work was not easy. The founders often disagreed, often quite passionately. But in the end, the Constitution of the United States laid out the foundations of our democracy, including the rule of law, that there would be checks and balances, that we would have free and fair elections, and a peaceful transfer of power. And these principles and traditions have sustained our nation for over two centuries. Sustained because generations of Americans from all backgrounds, from all beliefs, have cherished them, upheld them, and defended them. And now the baton is in our hands. So I am joined today by over 100 Republican leaders from across Pennsylvania and across our country who are supporting my candidacy for president of the United States. And I am deeply honored to have their support. Some served in state houses, some in the United States Congress, some worked for other Republican presidents and presidential nominees, including Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan. And some today served in Donald Trump's own administration. We also have with us Republican voters from here in Pennsylvania and beyond who have been active in their Republican parties for years, who have supported Republican candidates up and down the ticket.",chunk_10,346
2024-10-16,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania with former U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger",chunk,"Now, I say all that to make an obvious point. In a typical election year, you all being here with me might be a bit surprising, dare I say unusual. But not in this election. Not in this election. Because at stake in this race are the Democratic ideals that our founders and generations of Americans before us have fought for. At stake in this election is the Constitution of the United States, it very self. We are here today because we share a core belief that we must put country before party. We chant that with such great pride because we all know we all have so much more in common than what separates us. And at some point in the career of the folks who joined me on stage, one of the other things that we have in common is in our careers, we have each sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States. And so we know that sacred oath must always be honored and never violated. And that we should expect anyone who seeks the highest office in our land would meet that standard. We here know the Constitution is not a relic from our past, but determines whether we are a country where the people can speak freely and even criticize the president without fear of being thrown in jail or targeted by the military. Where the people can worship as they choose without the government interfering. Where you can vote without fear that your vote will be thrown away. All of this and more depends on whether or not our leaders honor their oaths to the Constitution. I have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution six times, including as Vice President, as the United States Senator, and as the top law enforcement officer of the largest state in our country. And I have never wavered from upholding that oath. And this is a profound difference between Donald Trump and me. He who violated the oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and make no mistake, he who, if given the chance, will violate it again. Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. And he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of a free and fair election.",chunk_11,382
2024-10-16,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania with former U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger",chunk,"He sent a mob, an armed mob, to the United States Capitol where they violently assaulted police officers, law enforcement officials, and threatened the life of his own vice president. And he refused to engage in the peaceful transfer of power. Were it not for the courage and patriotism of Vice President Pence that day, Donald Trump might have actually succeeded in overturning the will of the American people. Let's reflect on that. And now, Donald Trump is telling us how he intends to use power if he is elected again. He has stated that one of the biggest threats America faces is, quote, the enemy from within. The enemy from within. But nowhere that language harkens back to. Understand and let us be clear about what he is saying. He considers any American who doesn't support him or bend to his will to be an enemy to our country. And further, he says that as commander in chief, he would use our military to go after them. Honestly, let that sink in. Use of the American military? To go after American citizens? And we know who he would target first, because he has targeted them and attacked them before. Journalists whose stories he doesn't like. Nonpartisan election officials who refused to cheat by finding extra votes for him. Judges who insist on following the law instead of following him. It is clear Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged. And he is seeking unchecked power. Consider what his closest advisors have said. His national security advisor, two defense secretaries, his former chief of staff, his own vice president. All have warned America Donald Trump is unfit to serve. Or listen to General Milley. Donald Trump's top general. He has called Trump, and I quote, fascist to the core. And said, quote, no one has ever been as dangerous to this country. So think about that. General Milley served in uniform for more than 40 years, commanding American forces around the world. He has confronted some of America's worst enemies. And he is saying no one has ever been as dangerous to our country as Donald Trump.",chunk_12,357
2024-10-16,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania with former U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger",chunk,"America must heed this warning because anyone who tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has, anyone who has called for the quote termination of the Constitution of the United States as Donald Trump has, must never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. Never again. And to those, and to those who are watching, if you share that view, no matter your party, no matter who you voted for last time, there is a place for you in this campaign. The coalition we have built was ready to turn the page on the chaos and instability of Donald Trump. And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans. And I take that pledge seriously. I take that pledge quite seriously. So as I've mentioned, many of you know, I spent a career as a prosecutor in law enforcement, and I will tell you, I never asked a victim or a witness, are you a Republican or are you a Democrat? I never asked of anyone who needed help. If anyone who deserved attention, where were they registered and who did they vote for? The only question I ever asked was, are you okay? And that is the kind of president I pledge to you that I will be. That is my pledge to you. Because we have too much to do and too much good work to do to be relegated, to requiring each of us to be in some silo disconnected from each other. There's too much good to be done. And the challenges that we face as a nation require us, if we truly want, to create solutions and strengthen our nation. The approach truly requires that we understand we're all in this together. This is so much more than rhetoric or a campaign. It really is about tapping into the spirit of who we are as Americans. Because we are all in this together. We are all in this together. And so I pledge to be a president who actively works to unite us around our highest aspirations. I pledge to be you, to be a president who is realistic and practical and has common sense and to always fight for the American people. Unlike Donald Trump, who frankly as we have seen, cares more about running on problems than fixing problems.",chunk_13,397
2024-10-16,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania with former U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger",chunk,"I want to fix problems, which means working across the aisle. It requires working across the aisle. It requires embracing good ideas from wherever they come. That is why I have pledged to appoint a Republican in my cabinet. That is why I have pledged to establish a council on bipartisan solutions to recommend to me common sense solutions to some of the most pressing issues facing our country. Because nobody has a corner on the good ideas. They actually come from many places and one should, especially if they want to be a leader, one should welcome those ideas. And those ideas, which are about in particular strengthening the middle class, securing our border, defending our freedoms, and maintaining our leadership in the world. And all of this is to also say that I believe for America to be the world's strongest democracy, we must have a healthy two-party system. Because it is when we have a healthy two-party system that leaders are then required to debate the merits of policy and to work yes across the aisle regularly and routinely to get things done. And I have experienced firsthand how important and rewarding that kind of bipartisan cooperation can be. So I'll tell you, when I was the United States Senator, I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee. It was actually my favorite committee for a number of reasons, but specifically this. There we dealt with some of the most pressing issues affecting national security. There we would talk about hot spots around the world and what we needed to do to focus on keeping America safe and secure. And to do that, we would review classified information which required us to meet in a secure room. Adam, you know, it's called a skiff. Okay. When we would go in that room, with all due respect, no cameras were allowed. No press. And we would roll up our sleeves and get to work. I'm telling you, senators of both parties would walk in that room, take off their suit jackets, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table. And we would have real conversations.",chunk_14,360

Because we understood that what happened in that room, well, the stakes were so high. And therefore, it could not be, we could not afford to let it be about whether one was a Democrat or a Republican. The stakes were too high. We were in that room and it was all about us as Americans. About doing what is in the best interest of the safety and security of our nation. I love that work. And it was what we have is the theme of today. It was country over party in action. In action. So I know it can be done. And that is the standard of leadership and the aspiration that I have in terms of how we will work when with your help, I am elected president of the United States. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So we got to get to work. We got to get to work. So let me just say an obvious point. There's a fundamental choice in this election, a very fundamental choice. A choice between the leadership that I pledged to offer to America, leadership that brings folks together that builds consensus and focuses on making life better for you with the knowledge that we have so much more in common than what separates us. And on the other hand, the choice of someone who I think we can guarantee will sit in the Oval Office plotting retribution, stew in his own grievances and think only about himself and not you. So as I have said, our campaign is not a fight against something. It is a fight for something. It is a fight for the fundamental principles upon which we were founded. It is a fight for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can achieve together, Republicans, Democrats and independents who want to move past the politics of division and blame and get things done on behalf of the American people. And when it all comes down to it, I know we are all here together this beautiful afternoon because we love our country. We love our country.

Hey everybody. Hey so many of you may know when I was five years old we lived in Wisconsin. My parents taught for a short time here and now every time I land Governor Evers will meet me and he'll say welcome home. So, but it's so good to be back with everyone and thank you all for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this evening. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And it's great to be with just this incredible group of leaders including of course Ben Wichler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. There he is Ben. Kristen Lahrle who we need to send to the United States Congress. And Green Bay lets reelect someone who has spent her career fighting for Wisconsin families and manufacturing right here in Wisconsin your Senator Tammy Baldwin. We need her back in DC. We are also joined by tribal leaders including President Holsey who is here from the Stockbridge Muncie Band of Mohican Indians. And I will say Madam President that I strongly believe that the relationship between tribal nations and the United States is sacred and that we must honor tribal sovereignty, embrace trust and treaty obligations and ensure tribal self-determination. And as President I will defend those principles. All right Green Bay. So Green Bay we have 19 days until Election Day. 19 days. So we are entering the home stretch and this is going to be a tight race until the very end. Look we are the underdog and that's why we are and I am campaigning to earn every single vote because I intend to be a president for all Americans. No matter their political party where they live or where they get their news. On that point last night you may have seen that I went on Fox News. Meanwhile Donald Trump joined a Univision Town Hall yesterday where a voter asked him about January 6th. Okay. Now we here know January 6th was a tragic day. A tragic day for our country. It was a day of terrible violence with attacks on law enforcement. 140 law enforcement officers were injured that day. Law enforcement officers were killed that day. And what did Donald Trump say last night about January 6th? He called it quote a day of love. And we are all clear the American people are exhausted with his gaslighting. Exhausted. Enough. Enough. We are ready to turn the page. Turn the page. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. And the reason Wisconsin is because we know this election is about two very different visions for our country. One that is focused on the past, his, and ours that is focused on the future. And the future. Because we know America is ready for a new way forward. Ready for a new optimistic generation of leadership. All of us. It's all of us. Which is why Democrats and Republicans and independents are supporting our campaign. In fact, yesterday over 100 Republican leaders from across the country joined me on the campaign trail. Including some who had previously served in Trump's administration. And I believe it is because America wants a president who will serve on behalf of all the American people. And that has been the story of my entire career. My entire career I've only ever had one client. The people. The people. As a young courtroom prosecutor I stood up for women and children against predators. As an attorney general of California I took on the big banks and fought to deliver 20 billion dollars for middle class families that faced foreclosure. I stood up to veterans and stood up for, excuse me, stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for profit colleges. You know who else who ran a big for profit college? Let's not forget. And I stood up for those veterans and students who were being scammed by for profit colleges that were trying to rip them from their dreams and charge them producing nothing in return. I have stood up for workers who have been cheated out of the wages they were due. I stood up for seniors who are facing elder abuse and as president I will always fight for the American people. I will always fight for the American people. And together we will build a brighter future for our nation. Together. And it's a future where we build what I call an opportunity economy where America has an opportunity to do for our people what we know is part of our ambition, our dreams, our aspirations. An opportunity economy where everyone has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business. And under my plan we will bring down the cost of housing. Including with a $25,000 down payment assistance so you can just get your foot in the door. You do the hard work of saving up and paying that mortgage but let's be honest. You know the American dream was that was real for generations past but not so much within the reach of people right now. And we got to deal with the real challenges that people are facing right now if we're going to invest in the future. Part of my plan is about helping entrepreneurs start and grow small businesses. Look, my mother worked hard and there was a woman who lived two doors down from us, our neighbor who helped my mother raise us. She was a small business owner. I know who our small business owners are. You are not only business leaders, you are community leaders, you are civic leaders and it is our small businesses who are the backbone of America's economy. I know that to be true. Do we have any small business owners here tonight? Raise your hand. Under my plan we will expand Medicare to cover home health care for seniors. This is based on what I personally know. So look, when my mother was sick, I took care of her. And one of the things for anyone who is in that situation or has been, you know, what it's like. It's about cooking for folks in a way that hopefully they'll want to eat. It's about trying to find the clothes that won't be too rough on their skin. It's about trying to from time to time think of something that can put a smile on their face or make them laugh. It's about dignity. It's about dignity. But the reality is, it is expensive if you don't have the ability to do it. It is expensive to try and bring somebody in and far too many people then have to quit their job to try and take care of their elder relatives. And that's not right. That's not right. And so we also know there are so many people in what we call the sandwich generation, right, who are raising young children while you're taking care of your parents. And it's almost impossible to do it all. So my point is this, either under the current system you pay down and lose all your savings so you can qualify for Medicaid. Or you know what I'm saying. Either you have to give it all up and to be able to qualify for Medicaid or you're going to have to quit your job or somehow figure out how you can afford to bring in help. My plan is that instead we're going to have Medicare cover home healthcare for those who need it. Because the details matter. The details matter. In an opportunity economy, here's how I see it. We must create good paying jobs that are available to all Americans and not just those with college degrees. Okay? Because here's the thing. A college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a qualified worker. Which is why as president I will get rid of unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs and I will challenge the private sector to do the same. And we will lower costs on everything from healthcare to groceries and take on corporate price gouging. I've done it before and I will do it again. My plan will also give a middle class tax cut to 100 million Americans including $6,000 during the first year of your child's life. Because here's the thing. We know the vast majority of parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources. And that shouldn't be the thing that gets in the way of giving a child all that we know parents have to give. And the $6,000 by extending that child tax credit, that's what's going to help. You buy a crib or a car seat and all the things that that child needs during that most critical phase of their development. And I share with you some of these details to say this. I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class and I will never forget where I come from. Never. Never. Now Donald Trump has a different plan. Just Google Project 2025. You know, I mean, I keep saying this, but I can't believe they put that thing in writing. You know, I just, and they just put it in writing. They bound it and then they handed it out. And if you read it, look, it's a detailed, it's a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. You know, many of you have heard me say, I do believe that Donald Trump is an unserious man. But the consequences of him being president again are brutally serious, brutally serious. Because here's the thing, Donald Trump will give tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations just like he did before. He will cut Social Security and Medicare and get rid of the $35 cap on insulin for seniors. Check this out when you look at Project 2025. He will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers. And he will impose what I call a Trump sales tax, which is at least a 20% tax on everyday basic necessities, which economists have estimated will cost the average American over $4,000 more a year. And on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And he has no plan to replace it. So you watch the debate. He has quote, concepts of a plan. Come on. But again, it's a serious issue because here's the thing, he's going to then threaten health insurance coverage for 45 million Americans based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies were denying people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was? Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. And we are not going back because just like Wisconsin State Model tells us, we will move forward. Because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And no matter how he'd like to gaslight us, we are clear about how we got here. Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did as he intended. And now in America, one in three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban. And you've heard the stories, awful stories, painful stories of the experiences people have been having since that came down. I mean, think about it. Some of these states, there's no exception even for rape or incest, which means telling a survivor of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That's immoral. That's immoral. And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree. The government should not be telling her what to do. Not the government. And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly sign it into law. Proudly. That's why you got to get Tammy back to the Senate, by the way. Now, Donald Trump has a very different view on reproductive freedom. And he refuses continuously, he refuses continuously to acknowledge the harm he has caused. See, for yourself. Let's roll a clip. And I did it. Because for 54 years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it. So the women thing, I did a great thing long term, and I think they'll understand, when the Roe v. Wade, I did a great thing. I want to talk about IVF. I'm the father of IVF. Okay. The courts will take care of that. Let's take care of November. We'll take care of November. Now, I mean seriously. So first of all, no Donald, everybody did not want Roe v. Wade to be overturned. Women are dying of sepsis because they cannot get the health care they need. They did not want this. Couples just trying to grow their family are being cut off in the middle of IVF treatment. They did not want this. And now, I mean it just gets more unbelievable sometimes. And now the man calls himself the father of IVF. I mean what does that even mean? And all of that while he is the one who by the way is responsible for it being at risk in the first place. And what is sadly, what is sadly interesting I think, is that when you listen to Donald Trump talk, it becomes increasingly clear I think he has no idea what he's talking about. When it comes to the health care of women in America. And across our nation, again because this is serious, right? You know this is why you all are here spending so much time when you could be doing other things. Listen, across our nation we are witnessing a full on assault on other and additional hard fought, hard won freedoms and rights. Like the freedom to vote. You see what's happening around our country. A tax on the freedom to join a union. A tax on the freedom to just be safe from gun violence. A tax on the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. So much is on the line in this election. And this is not 2016 and it's not 2020. The stakes are even higher. Because a few months ago the Supreme Court told the former president that he is effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House. Now just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Think about that. He who has vowed if re-elected he will be a dictator on day one. That he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. He who calls Americans who disagree with him the enemy from within. And yes, and says that if re-elected he would use the military to go after them. He who has called for the quote termination of the Constitution of the United States. And let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. Never again. Never again. So Wisconsin, it comes down to this. I know we are all here together because we know what is at stake. And we are here together because we love our country. We love, we love our country. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, of an expression of the love of our country to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America. And that's what we are doing. So election day is in 19 days. And here in Wisconsin early voting starts next Tuesday, October 22nd. So now is the time to make your plan to vote. And if you have received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today. And remember, Wisconsin has same day voter registration. So if, right? So if you are not registered to vote, you can register when you vote on election day or early. Because folks, the election is here. And so we know we need to organize. We need to energize. We need to mobilize. And we got to remind everybody, your vote is your voice. And your voice is your power. In a democracy, it still remains true that each individual has the power. Each individual has the power to weigh in on this. And so Wisconsin today, I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.",full,2965

And it's a future where we build what I call an opportunity economy where America has an opportunity to do for our people what we know is part of our ambition, our dreams, our aspirations. An opportunity economy where everyone has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business. And under my plan we will bring down the cost of housing. Including with a $25,000 down payment assistance so you can just get your foot in the door. You do the hard work of saving up and paying that mortgage but let's be honest. You know the American dream was that was real for generations past but not so much within the reach of people right now. And we got to deal with the real challenges that people are facing right now if we're going to invest in the future. Part of my plan is about helping entrepreneurs start and grow small businesses. Look, my mother worked hard and there was a woman who lived two doors down from us, our neighbor who helped my mother raise us. She was a small business owner. I know who our small business owners are. You are not only business leaders, you are community leaders, you are civic leaders and it is our small businesses who are the backbone of America's economy. I know that to be true. Do we have any small business owners here tonight? Raise your hand. Under my plan we will expand Medicare to cover home health care for seniors. This is based on what I personally know. So look, when my mother was sick, I took care of her. And one of the things for anyone who is in that situation or has been, you know, what it's like. It's about cooking for folks in a way that hopefully they'll want to eat. It's about trying to find the clothes that won't be too rough on their skin. It's about trying to from time to time think of something that can put a smile on their face or make them laugh. It's about dignity. It's about dignity. But the reality is, it is expensive if you don't have the ability to do it.",chunk_3,390
2024-10-17,Rally,"Kamala Harris held rally at Green Bay, WI ",chunk,"It is expensive to try and bring somebody in and far too many people then have to quit their job to try and take care of their elder relatives. And that's not right. That's not right. And so we also know there are so many people in what we call the sandwich generation, right, who are raising young children while you're taking care of your parents. And it's almost impossible to do it all. So my point is this, either under the current system you pay down and lose all your savings so you can qualify for Medicaid. Or you know what I'm saying. Either you have to give it all up and to be able to qualify for Medicaid or you're going to have to quit your job or somehow figure out how you can afford to bring in help. My plan is that instead we're going to have Medicare cover home healthcare for those who need it. Because the details matter. The details matter. In an opportunity economy, here's how I see it. We must create good paying jobs that are available to all Americans and not just those with college degrees. Okay? Because here's the thing. A college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a qualified worker. Which is why as president I will get rid of unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs and I will challenge the private sector to do the same. And we will lower costs on everything from healthcare to groceries and take on corporate price gouging. I've done it before and I will do it again. My plan will also give a middle class tax cut to 100 million Americans including $6,000 during the first year of your child's life. Because here's the thing. We know the vast majority of parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources. And that shouldn't be the thing that gets in the way of giving a child all that we know parents have to give. And the $6,000 by extending that child tax credit, that's what's going to help. You buy a crib or a car seat and all the things that that child needs during that most critical phase of their development.",chunk_4,380
2024-10-17,Rally,"Kamala Harris held rally at Green Bay, WI ",chunk,"And I share with you some of these details to say this. I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class and I will never forget where I come from. Never. Never. Now Donald Trump has a different plan. Just Google Project 2025. You know, I mean, I keep saying this, but I can't believe they put that thing in writing. You know, I just, and they just put it in writing. They bound it and then they handed it out. And if you read it, look, it's a detailed, it's a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. You know, many of you have heard me say, I do believe that Donald Trump is an unserious man. But the consequences of him being president again are brutally serious, brutally serious. Because here's the thing, Donald Trump will give tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations just like he did before. He will cut Social Security and Medicare and get rid of the $35 cap on insulin for seniors. Check this out when you look at Project 2025. He will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers. And he will impose what I call a Trump sales tax, which is at least a 20% tax on everyday basic necessities, which economists have estimated will cost the average American over $4,000 more a year. And on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And he has no plan to replace it. So you watch the debate. He has quote, concepts of a plan. Come on. But again, it's a serious issue because here's the thing, he's going to then threaten health insurance coverage for 45 million Americans based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies were denying people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was? Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. And we are not going back because just like Wisconsin State Model tells us, we will move forward. Because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom.",chunk_5,394
2024-10-17,Rally,"Kamala Harris held rally at Green Bay, WI ",chunk,"Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And no matter how he'd like to gaslight us, we are clear about how we got here. Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did as he intended. And now in America, one in three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban. And you've heard the stories, awful stories, painful stories of the experiences people have been having since that came down. I mean, think about it. Some of these states, there's no exception even for rape or incest, which means telling a survivor of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That's immoral. That's immoral. And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree. The government should not be telling her what to do. Not the government. And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly sign it into law. Proudly. That's why you got to get Tammy back to the Senate, by the way. Now, Donald Trump has a very different view on reproductive freedom. And he refuses continuously, he refuses continuously to acknowledge the harm he has caused. See, for yourself. Let's roll a clip. And I did it. Because for 54 years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it. So the women thing, I did a great thing long term, and I think they'll understand, when the Roe v. Wade, I did a great thing. I want to talk about IVF. I'm the father of IVF. Okay. The courts will take care of that. Let's take care of November. We'll take care of November. Now, I mean seriously. So first of all, no Donald, everybody did not want Roe v. Wade to be overturned. Women are dying of sepsis because they cannot get the health care they need.",chunk_6,380
2024-10-17,Rally,"Kamala Harris held rally at Green Bay, WI ",chunk,"They did not want this. Couples just trying to grow their family are being cut off in the middle of IVF treatment. They did not want this. And now, I mean it just gets more unbelievable sometimes. And now the man calls himself the father of IVF. I mean what does that even mean? And all of that while he is the one who by the way is responsible for it being at risk in the first place. And what is sadly, what is sadly interesting I think, is that when you listen to Donald Trump talk, it becomes increasingly clear I think he has no idea what he's talking about. When it comes to the health care of women in America. And across our nation, again because this is serious, right? You know this is why you all are here spending so much time when you could be doing other things. Listen, across our nation we are witnessing a full on assault on other and additional hard fought, hard won freedoms and rights. Like the freedom to vote. You see what's happening around our country. A tax on the freedom to join a union. A tax on the freedom to just be safe from gun violence. A tax on the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. So much is on the line in this election. And this is not 2016 and it's not 2020. The stakes are even higher. Because a few months ago the Supreme Court told the former president that he is effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House. Now just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Think about that. He who has vowed if re-elected he will be a dictator on day one. That he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. He who calls Americans who disagree with him the enemy from within. And yes, and says that if re-elected he would use the military to go after them. He who has called for the quote termination of the Constitution of the United States. And let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again.",chunk_7,384
2024-10-17,Rally,"Kamala Harris held rally at Green Bay, WI ",chunk,"Never again. Never again. So Wisconsin, it comes down to this. I know we are all here together because we know what is at stake. And we are here together because we love our country. We love, we love our country. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, of an expression of the love of our country to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America. And that's what we are doing. So election day is in 19 days. And here in Wisconsin early voting starts next Tuesday, October 22nd. So now is the time to make your plan to vote. And if you have received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today. And remember, Wisconsin has same day voter registration. So if, right? So if you are not registered to vote, you can register when you vote on election day or early. Because folks, the election is here. And so we know we need to organize. We need to energize. We need to mobilize. And we got to remind everybody, your vote is your voice. And your voice is your power. In a democracy, it still remains true that each individual has the power. Each individual has the power to weigh in on this. And so Wisconsin today, I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.",chunk_8,284
2024-10-17,Rally,"Kamala Harris held rally at La Crosse, WI",full,"Good afternoon Wisconsin! Good afternoon! Oh, it's wonderful to be back in here at the University of Wisconsin-Lacrosse. Thank you all! Go Eagles! Oh, it's good to be everyone. And Mark Cuban, thank you for all that you are and being a part of it. Thank you. So some of you may know, when I was five years old, we lived in Wisconsin. My parents taught at the University of Wisconsin in Madison for a time and every now, every time I come now, when I land, Governor Evers will greet me and he'll say, Welcome Home. So it is good to be back in Wisconsin. And this is a room full of leaders and I thank you all for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here to have this conversation. I want to thank Mayor Reynolds, thank you for the warm welcome and all you do. And Lacrosse, let's reelect someone who has spent her career fighting for the families of Wisconsin, your Senator Tammy Baldwin. We need her in Washington! We need her in Washington! Good. So, election day is in 19 days. 19 days. And if anyone, if you all have a chair or a seat, please do seat for anyone who has a chair, okay? So listen, we are nearing the home stretch and this is going to be a tight race until the very end. And we, we got this. And, and, reality check, we are the underdog, okay? And that's why I'm here with you and you are taking the time to do the hard work that is necessary. It's why I'm campaigning for every vote because I want and intend to be a president for all Americans. And no matter their political party, where they live or where they get their news, okay? And on that point, last night you may have seen I went on Fox News. And while I was doing that, Donald Trump was at a Univision town hall where a voter asked him about January 6th. Okay. So now we here know January 6th was a tragic day. It was a day of terrible violence. There were attacks on law enforcement, 140 law enforcement officers were injured, some were killed. And what did Donald Trump say last night about January 6th? He called it a quote, a day of love. But, but it points out something that everyone here knows. The American people are exhausted with his gaslighting. Exhausted with his gaslighting. Enough! We are ready to turn the page! Turn the page! We're done. And Wisconsin, I know we're not going back because this election... We're not going back! And we are not going back because we know that this election is about two very different visions for our nation. One that has focused his on the past and ours that is focused on the future. As represented by everyone here and especially the students who are here right now. Yeah, you guys. You guys. Yeah. Yeah. It's about you guys. It really is. It really is. And we know that America is ready for a new way forward. We are ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership. Which is why Democrats and independents and Republicans are supporting our campaign. In fact, just yesterday I was with over 100 Republican leaders from across the country who joined me on the campaign trail. And as they said, it was about putting country before party. And some of them served in Donald Trump's previous administration. The people who know him best. And I believe and I think we all know Americans want a president who works for all the American people. It's what we deserve. And that has been the story of my entire career. In my career I've only ever had one client, the people. When I was a young courtroom prosecutor, I stood up for women and children against predators. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks, fought to deliver $20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure. I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by for profit colleges. I stood up for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due. I stood up for seniors facing elder abuse. And I promise as president I will always fight for all the American people. And together, together, we can and we will build a future, a brighter future for our nation. That's why we're all here together. We love our country. Together we will build in that future what I call an opportunity economy. Which is where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build wealth. Under my plan, and I know this is a big deal for the young people here, we will bring down the cost of housing. Because there was a time that generations of Americans could count on the American dream. But for far too many these days, it is just out of reach. So we will deal with the housing supply. And I will commit to creating a $25,000 down payment assistance so you can for the first time home buyers just get your foot in the door. We will help entrepreneurs and small businesses to begin and grow. Because we know small businesses are part of America's backbone in terms of the strength of our economy. You know, the woman who helped raise my sister in me was a small business owner. We have small business owners who are here. You are not only business leaders, you are civic leaders, you are community leaders. And you really are part of the backbone of America's economy. And we've got to invest in you and make your jobs easier. My plan will help expand Medicare to cover home health care for seniors. And this is personal for me. So part of you may know, some of you may know that when my mother was sick, I took care of her. And for anybody who is taking care of an elder parent when they are in their time of need, the work includes trying to cook something that they feel like eating. Right? Helping them put on a sweater. Trying to make them just laugh from time to time. Right? It's about dignity. It's about dignity. But for far too many people, including people in the sandwich generation who are raising young children and taking care of a parent, oh, it's so rough. And so my plan is this. It's to say, instead of how it currently is, which is in order for you to be able to get help to come in, you're going to have to pretty much get rid of all your savings to qualify for Medicaid. What I'm saying is, no, this is a matter of dignity and it is a matter of your ability to participate in the workforce and be productive and have a quality of life. So we're going to change the system. So Medicare will cover your ability to have home health care for your elder parent. Because you see, part of the difference between the way we see our country and the world and the way my opponent sees it, is we actually see real people and care about them and have a sense of understanding about how tough times can be, but how good times can be if we put the work into solving problems instead of trying to run on problems like Donald Trump. And so that's why we will also lower costs on everything from health care to groceries, including taking on corporate price gouging, which I've done before and I will do again. And we will give a middle class tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 for young parents, for parents who are just starting out during the first year of their child's life, knowing the vast majority of our parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources to do it. And so this is about helping folks out to be able to buy a car seat and a crib just during that most critical phase of their child's development. This is all about dignity. And this is about understanding. And so I share this to say I will always put the middle class and working families first. It's where I come from and I will never forget where I come from. Now Donald Trump has a different plan. I love you back by the way. Thank you. Donald Trump has a different plan. So just Google project 2025. Now we're at a place of higher learning. I must say, I can't believe they put that thing in writing. I really can't. They put it in writing. They bound it. Like they bound it and handed it out. So look, we read it, right? It's a detailed and dangerous blueprint. For what he will do if he is elected president. You know, I said many times you've heard me say Donald Trump is an unserious man. And the consequences of him ever getting his foot back in the Oval Office are brutally serious. Brutally serious. So Donald Trump, right? That's why we're here. And we're here because we know we've got work to do still. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts. He will cut Social Security and Medicare. He will get rid of the $35 cap on insulin for seniors. He will make it easier for companies to check this out. He will make it easier for companies to check this out. He will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers. And will impose what I have named a Trump sales tax because essentially he plans on putting a 20% tax, if not higher, on everyday basic necessities which economists have estimated will cost the average American $4,000 more a year. And on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And he has no plan to replace it. You guys watch the debate. He has, quote, concepts of a plan. Concepts! Concepts! So here's the thing. Again, it's a serious issue, right? So he's going to threaten the health insurance coverage of 45 million people in America based on a concept. Taking us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was? Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. And just like Wisconsin State motto tells us, we will move forward. We will move forward. Because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. For freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. Right. Thank you. Thank you. And again, we're not going to be gaslighted on this. We remember Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court. And they did as he intended. Oh, you guys are at the wrong rally. No, I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street. So, but back to the matter at hand. We need a medic here. We need a medic. Right here. And let's part the way so someone can come through and bring help. Okay. Okay. All right. We're good. So on the subject of his intention and what he actually did to undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, let's understand what has happened since. It is now the case that in America, one in three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Many, many of these bands have no exception even for rape or incest. And you react that way because we understand the idea that someone who calls themselves a leader would even make no exceptions for a survivor of a violation to their body. And to tell that survivor they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That's immoral. That's immoral. That's immoral. That's immoral. That's immoral. That's immoral. And I know we all agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest or her pastor or her rabbi or her emomb, but not the government telling her what to do. And it is my pledge to you that when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. I will proudly sign it into law. I will proudly sign it into law. I will proudly sign it into law. Lots of work. Lots of work to do. So listen, so much is on the line in this election. You all know that. Again, that's why you're here. And this is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher because a few months ago, the United States Supreme Court told the former president he is effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House. Now think about that. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. He who has vowed if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one. He who has called for the termination of the Constitution of the United States of America. And let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. Never again. And then consider the comments that he made just in the last few days. He's got more. He said he will target and punish those who disagree with him or refuse to bend to his will. He calls these Americans the enemy within. And says that he would use the American military to go after American citizens. He's a journalist who stories he doesn't like. Nonpartisan election officials who refuse to cheat by finding a few extra votes for him. Judges who insist on following the law instead of following him. It is for reasons like these that General Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has called Trump's top general, has called Trump, and I quote, fascist to the core. And it is clear Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged. And will stop at nothing to claim unchecked power for himself. He wants to send the military after American citizens. He wants to prevent women from making decisions about their own body. He wants to threaten fundamental freedoms and rights like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. So much is on the line in this election. So much is on the line. And Wisconsin, when it comes down to it, look, we are all here together because we know what is at stake. We are all here together because we love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and fight, Cisco, you said it, to realize the promise of America. So election day is in 19 days, and here in Wisconsin early voting starts next Tuesday, October 22. So now is the time to make your plan to vote. And if you have received your ballot, if you have received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today. And remember that Wisconsin has same day voter registration. So if you are not registered to vote, you can register when you vote, and please do vote early or on election day. Because the election is, and bring an ID, because the election is here. And listen, I'm telling everybody what you already know what I've been doing. We've got to energize, let's mobilize, let's organize. Let's continue in this process also to do what everyone here is doing. Let's build community. You know? Let's build coalitions. Let's remind each other that we are all in this together. Let's remind each other we have so much more in common than what separates us. And let's do all this knowing that our vote is our voice and your voice is your power. So Wisconsin today I then ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you, God bless the United States of America.",full,2847

But for far too many people, including people in the sandwich generation who are raising young children and taking care of a parent, oh, it's so rough. And so my plan is this. It's to say, instead of how it currently is, which is in order for you to be able to get help to come in, you're going to have to pretty much get rid of all your savings to qualify for Medicaid. What I'm saying is, no, this is a matter of dignity and it is a matter of your ability to participate in the workforce and be productive and have a quality of life.",chunk_3,412
2024-10-17,Rally,"Kamala Harris held rally at La Crosse, WI",chunk,"So we're going to change the system. So Medicare will cover your ability to have home health care for your elder parent. Because you see, part of the difference between the way we see our country and the world and the way my opponent sees it, is we actually see real people and care about them and have a sense of understanding about how tough times can be, but how good times can be if we put the work into solving problems instead of trying to run on problems like Donald Trump. And so that's why we will also lower costs on everything from health care to groceries, including taking on corporate price gouging, which I've done before and I will do again. And we will give a middle class tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 for young parents, for parents who are just starting out during the first year of their child's life, knowing the vast majority of our parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources to do it. And so this is about helping folks out to be able to buy a car seat and a crib just during that most critical phase of their child's development. This is all about dignity. And this is about understanding. And so I share this to say I will always put the middle class and working families first. It's where I come from and I will never forget where I come from. Now Donald Trump has a different plan. I love you back by the way. Thank you. Donald Trump has a different plan. So just Google project 2025. Now we're at a place of higher learning. I must say, I can't believe they put that thing in writing. I really can't. They put it in writing. They bound it. Like they bound it and handed it out. So look, we read it, right? It's a detailed and dangerous blueprint. For what he will do if he is elected president. You know, I said many times you've heard me say Donald Trump is an unserious man. And the consequences of him ever getting his foot back in the Oval Office are brutally serious. Brutally serious. So Donald Trump, right? That's why we're here.",chunk_4,382
2024-10-17,Rally,"Kamala Harris held rally at La Crosse, WI",chunk,"And we're here because we know we've got work to do still. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts. He will cut Social Security and Medicare. He will get rid of the $35 cap on insulin for seniors. He will make it easier for companies to check this out. He will make it easier for companies to check this out. He will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers. And will impose what I have named a Trump sales tax because essentially he plans on putting a 20% tax, if not higher, on everyday basic necessities which economists have estimated will cost the average American $4,000 more a year. And on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And he has no plan to replace it. You guys watch the debate. He has, quote, concepts of a plan. Concepts! Concepts! So here's the thing. Again, it's a serious issue, right? So he's going to threaten the health insurance coverage of 45 million people in America based on a concept. Taking us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was? Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. And just like Wisconsin State motto tells us, we will move forward. We will move forward. Because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. For freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. Right. Thank you. Thank you. And again, we're not going to be gaslighted on this. We remember Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court. And they did as he intended. Oh, you guys are at the wrong rally. No, I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street. So, but back to the matter at hand. We need a medic here. We need a medic. Right here. And let's part the way so someone can come through and bring help. Okay. Okay. All right. We're good.

2024-10-17,Rally,"Kamala Harris held rally at La Crosse, WI",chunk,"Wade, let's understand what has happened since. It is now the case that in America, one in three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Many, many of these bands have no exception even for rape or incest. And you react that way because we understand the idea that someone who calls themselves a leader would even make no exceptions for a survivor of a violation to their body. And to tell that survivor they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That's immoral. That's immoral. That's immoral. That's immoral. That's immoral. That's immoral. And I know we all agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest or her pastor or her rabbi or her emomb, but not the government telling her what to do. And it is my pledge to you that when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. I will proudly sign it into law. I will proudly sign it into law. I will proudly sign it into law. Lots of work. Lots of work to do. So listen, so much is on the line in this election. You all know that. Again, that's why you're here. And this is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher because a few months ago, the United States Supreme Court told the former president he is effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House. Now think about that. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. He who has vowed if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one. He who has called for the termination of the Constitution of the United States of America. And let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. Never again. And then consider the comments that he made just in the last few days. He's got more.",chunk_6,381
2024-10-17,Rally,"Kamala Harris held rally at La Crosse, WI",chunk,"He said he will target and punish those who disagree with him or refuse to bend to his will. He calls these Americans the enemy within. And says that he would use the American military to go after American citizens. He's a journalist who stories he doesn't like. Nonpartisan election officials who refuse to cheat by finding a few extra votes for him. Judges who insist on following the law instead of following him. It is for reasons like these that General Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has called Trump's top general, has called Trump, and I quote, fascist to the core. And it is clear Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged. And will stop at nothing to claim unchecked power for himself. He wants to send the military after American citizens. He wants to prevent women from making decisions about their own body. He wants to threaten fundamental freedoms and rights like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. So much is on the line in this election. So much is on the line. And Wisconsin, when it comes down to it, look, we are all here together because we know what is at stake. We are all here together because we love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and fight, Cisco, you said it, to realize the promise of America. So election day is in 19 days, and here in Wisconsin early voting starts next Tuesday, October 22. So now is the time to make your plan to vote. And if you have received your ballot, if you have received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today. And remember that Wisconsin has same day voter registration.

I just said to him, I mean what a leader he is. You know, I just, first of all, it's so good to be in the House of Labor and it's so good to be people who understand the dignity of work and fight for it every day. And it's not an easy fight, but it's a good fight. And I thank you for all that you do, Ben, and everybody. Thank you. So it's wonderful to be back in Michigan and to be with so many incredible leaders including of course Representative Schlacken. Where is she? There you are. Who we must elect to be United States House Representative. And we know that the House of Representatives, State Senator Hurtel, let's send him to the United States House of Representatives. And a special thanks to the brothers and sisters of United Auto Workers. Thank you for all that you are, all that you do. And of course for generations and Lansing and across our country, Union members have helped lead the fight for fair pay, better benefits and safe working conditions. And every person in our nation has benefited from your work. You know, everywhere I go I tell people, you may not be a Union member, but you better thank unions. And I thank you for the big leave, for paid family leave and vacation time. Because we are all clear, collective bargaining benefits our entire nation. Our entire nation. So here's the deal, when Union wages go up, everybody's wages go up. When unions workplaces are safer, everyone's workplace is safer. So thank the Union. Thank you. And the bottom line is when unions are strong, America is strong. Unions have always fought to make our nation more equal, more fair and more free. And in this election, everything we have fought for, for years in this movement, in this movement for unions and for labor, is on the line. And I'm about to talk about it in real terms, because we always have real talk with each other. And your members can afford nothing less, which has been my, I appreciate your leadership. This election is about two very different visions for our nation. One that's trying to take us backward, him. And ours that is about moving forward and about the future. We fight, we fight for a future where we protect the freedom to organize. Or we understand the importance of collective bargaining. You know, I sometimes say to young people, by the way, have you noticed how when you look at the polling, younger workers coming into the workforce, they get it. And they understand the power and the nobility of unions. And I always say to people, look, here's the thing about collective bargaining. Everybody should want that when there's a negotiation, the outcome would be fair. Who's going to argue with that? Everybody should want that. That there will be a fair outcome in a negotiation. All right, so if we start from there all reasonable people, then let's think about it. If you're talking about the worker, the one worker, trying to negotiate against the corporation. Is that outcome going to be fair? No. The disparity in power is too great. So collective bargaining, it's a simple, simple and important point. You let the workers organize so that the collective together who have the same concerns, the same issues, can be banded together to have equal power in a negotiation. Because the whole point is the outcome of the negotiation should be fair. That's what collective bargaining is about. That's what unions are about. So it's about basic fairness and it's about the dignity of work. Understanding all workers deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. That's what we're talking about when we talk about this movement and the strength of the movement and the importance of keeping it going. When we talk about then, our knowledge about the importance of building a future where we tap into the ambition of the American people. Where we build what I call an opportunity economy, right? So every American has an opportunity to own a home, to buy a car, to build wealth, to start a business. I will always, it is my pledge to you, put the middle class and working people first. I come from the middle class and I will never forget where I come from. That's what I'm talking about. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work and must receive the value to which it is due, which means understanding the value of the worker. And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing. Over the last three and a half years, we brought manufacturing back to America, creating 730,000 manufacturing jobs. With your help, we announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States and we did it by investing in American industry and American workers. And I will make sure America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century. So on the last plan, it's about investing in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, the great American auto industry. And we will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs from advanced batteries to electric vehicles are not just invented but built right here in America by American union workers. And as part of that vision, we will invest in manufacturing communities like Lansing. We will retool existing factories, hire locally and work with unions to create good paying jobs, including, by the way, jobs that do not require a college degree. And I'm going to tell you why, because I'm really clear that a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a qualified worker. And we need to understand that. In fact, it is my pledge that as president, I'm going to do a critical assessment of federal jobs to look at those that don't require a college degree so we can start talking about good jobs based on the skill and experience of the worker and not random measures of who can do what. And I plan on the challenge of the private sector to do the same. And we will, importantly, protect the pensions of union workers and retirees. I'm going to talk about the dignity of work, which includes the dignity of retirement. After a lifetime of work and hard, let's talk about the dignity of retirement, the dignity of aging. And that's why, as attorney general, I sued the big banks to return hundreds of millions of dollars to workers and their families after their pensions were mismanaged. This is not new to me. I've done that work. As the United States Senator, I pushed for legislation to rescue workers' pensions without cutting the benefits that workers had earned. And as vice president, I worked alongside then-secretary of labor Marty Walsh, and we, for a year, worked on what we needed to do with the federal workforce, which was in our direct power, to increase the ability for collective bargaining, and to ensure that they have all the resources they need to grow in terms of organizing. As vice president, I also helped to do the long overdue work to protect the pensions of more than one million union members. And yesterday, I announced the protection of the full-earned pension benefits of more than 22,500 union workers, and 25 million union members. I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question.

I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the first question. I know that he's a worker of hard work, of the dignity of work. You guys, we know it. We know it. He tries to do his rhetorical thing at rallies like he understands what it means to earn a living. No, you understand what I'm saying? He understands workers and the hard work and the battle workers face every day to get their due wages and benefits. Well, we're not falling for the oaky-dough. We know what he has said and we know what he has done. He called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. He called it a Ponzi scheme. He recommended we raise the retirement age to 70. Can you imagine if you were required to work to 70? He who intends to cut Social Security and Medicare? You know, we know how many people their only source of income is their Social Security. Talk about, right, is the value about dignity and retirement, dignity and managing? And remember, he was the only one he said he was going to be the only one who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs. Do you know how he does? I'm the only one, right? And then because we're too busy watching what he's doing to hear what he's saying, we know America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president, okay? Including tens of thousands of jobs right here in Michigan. And those losses, we know and will note, started in the first pandemic, okay? Making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers manufacturing jobs in American history. And his track record for the auto industry was a disaster. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, I'm going to quote, not lose one plant under his presidency. Then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stalances in Detroit. Thousands of Michigan auto workers lost their jobs. And if he wins again, we can expect there would be more of the same. Because we know what he has done. And we know that we're going to focus on the work, not the words when it comes to Donald Trump. And we know where he took us the last time. And check this out, Donald Trump's current running man, because you know the job is open, right? You know, like when people go for an interview, especially the young people, they'll go for an interview and they'll sit down and they're in the interview and they'll say, why is the job open? Well, we know why that job was open. So Donald Trump's running mate recently suggested that if they win, they would threaten the Grand River Assembly plant right here in Lansing. The same plant that with your help, our administration protected earlier this year, say thanks to St. Henry and his family. And I'm going to leave some of the union workers from Grand River here with us today. So you know what I'm talking about. And Donald Trump's running mate called your jobs table scraps, right? So let me just say, needless to say, I will always have your back. And we'll keep fighting to make sure that you keep your jobs right here in Lansing and keep these most noble and important jobs for America's strength. That's the work you all do. You know, Donald Trump, he also promised that he was going to stop off-shoring. Remember that? Then he cut taxes for corporations that shipped 200,000 jobs overseas during his presidency. Cut the taxes for those corporations. And awarded nearly half a trillion dollars in federal contracts to companies that were off-shoring jobs. All of the money. He gave your tax dollars to companies that were sending your jobs overseas. And we got to get the word out to all of the brothers and sisters in labor to remind them of what this dude does. Right? What the actual he does. Because make no mistake, Donald Trump is no friend to labor. He is no friend to labor. And we got to listen to what he says. Know that you know that famous saying, listen when people tell you who they are. In fact, can we roll the clip? Let's see. Here we go. He's in a hate debate over time. When I was at the private sectors they said, oh, I don't want over at United. I shouldn't tell you this. I'd go out and get other people out of work regular time. They build everything in Germany and then they assemble it here. They get away with murder because they say, oh yes, we're building a cell. They take them out of a box and they assemble them. We could have our child. They go, I can easily, that's okay. You're all gone. You're all gone. The United Auto Workers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen. And the leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately. So of course that last bit he was talking about Sean Faye, who represents nearly a million active and retired auto workers. Okay, so that's about a million auto workers active and retired. Donald Trump, listen to his words. He's saying that auto workers are essentially engaged in child's play. That children can do it. Listen to what he says. I'm telling you, he's got his club. And I'm going to tell you, union workers are not part of his club. Let's be clear about that. No matter what he does in his rallies, let's be clear about that. Right? He thinks that the value of your work is essentially meaningless. That's what he's saying to compare it to child's work. When we here know the work you do is complex, you do it with great care. You work hard. You are highly skilled. You are highly trained. And the best auto workers in the world is who you are. And the fact is Donald Trump's comments are the time someone who has had everything handed to him. I know it's right. It is. I know it is. This man, you know, who never had to work a job that came with countless hands or an hourly wage, right? Someone who got handed $400 million on a silver platter and did what with it five bankruptcy six times. Come on. Come on. He will never understand the life and the work of a United Auto Worker. He will never understand that. People who work hard for everything they have, who take great pride in a job well done, who understand what it represents to their family and the future of their family. Again, I go back to the dignity of hard work. So let us be clear. Donald Trump's insults to American workers is not exclusive to that video, okay? So that was just a moment. Kind of think of it as the commercial break in my speech. But his comments are not only that, because Donald Trump has been a union buster his entire career. He has called union leaders quote, doosucking people. Okay? He said that he supports so-called right to work laws quote, 100%. Okay? He bragged and joked with a billionaire buddy about mass firing striking workers and lowered labor standards and made it easier for companies that break the laws to get federal contracts. Donald Trump encouraged automakers of Michigan so they could pay their workers less, encourage them to move so they could pay their workers less. Okay? And when the UAW went on strike to demand the higher wages you deserve, Donald Trump went to a non-union shop and attacked the UAW. He said striking and collective bargaining don't make it, I'm going to quote, a damn bit of difference. So here's the bottom line. Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people. And he is, I believe, an existential threat to America's labor movement. And everything he intends to do if he is re-elected is also spelled out in that project 2025. So to read it and to know what it is to know, he intends to launch a full-on attack on unions and the freedom to organize. Okay? So he will ban public sector unions, roll back workplace safety protections, read it when you have some time, Google it, everybody's watching. Look, he will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers and appoint a union buster to run the Department of Labor. Be sure of that. Be sure of that. All right, all friends here, I say what you already know. It's time to turn the page. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. Because as UAW always does, we are going to push forward. We are going to push forward. And it all comes down to this. Look, you all have taken time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. And we are all here together because we know the stakes in this election are so high. We are all here together because we love our country. We love our country. And I truly believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, the expression of the love of our country to fight for our ideals. And that's what this is about. This is not at the end of the day a fight against something. This is a fight for something. This is a fight for something. Including the fight to realize the promise of America. After all, that's what unions have always done. It's about understanding the promise of America, which has to include the promise that we should make to the workers of America. So we have 18 days to get this done. It's not a lot of time. And we know this is going to be a tight race until the very end. We are the underdog. But make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We can win. It's going to be hard work, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. And ultimately, we will win because we know what we stand for. And when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. We stand for opportunity. We stand for dignity. And we stand for the future. And so I'll close by saying, and when we fight, we will win. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",full,3297

We will retool existing factories, hire locally and work with unions to create good paying jobs, including, by the way, jobs that do not require a college degree. And I'm going to tell you why, because I'm really clear that a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a qualified worker. And we need to understand that. In fact, it is my pledge that as president, I'm going to do a critical assessment of federal jobs to look at those that don't require a college degree so we can start talking about good jobs based on the skill and experience of the worker and not random measures of who can do what. And I plan on the challenge of the private sector to do the same. And we will, importantly, protect the pensions of union workers and retirees. I'm going to talk about the dignity of work, which includes the dignity of retirement. After a lifetime of work and hard, let's talk about the dignity of retirement, the dignity of aging.",chunk_3,367

This is not new to me. I've done that work. As the United States Senator, I pushed for legislation to rescue workers' pensions without cutting the benefits that workers had earned. And as vice president, I worked alongside then-secretary of labor Marty Walsh, and we, for a year, worked on what we needed to do with the federal workforce, which was in our direct power, to increase the ability for collective bargaining, and to ensure that they have all the resources they need to grow in terms of organizing. As vice president, I also helped to do the long overdue work to protect the pensions of more than one million union members.

He tries to do his rhetorical thing at rallies like he understands what it means to earn a living. No, you understand what I'm saying? He understands workers and the hard work and the battle workers face every day to get their due wages and benefits. Well, we're not falling for the oaky-dough. We know what he has said and we know what he has done. He called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. He called it a Ponzi scheme. He recommended we raise the retirement age to 70. Can you imagine if you were required to work to 70? He who intends to cut Social Security and Medicare? You know, we know how many people their only source of income is their Social Security. Talk about, right, is the value about dignity and retirement, dignity and managing? And remember, he was the only one he said he was going to be the only one who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs. Do you know how he does? I'm the only one, right? And then because we're too busy watching what he's doing to hear what he's saying, we know America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president, okay? Including tens of thousands of jobs right here in Michigan. And those losses, we know and will note, started in the first pandemic, okay? Making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers manufacturing jobs in American history. And his track record for the auto industry was a disaster. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, I'm going to quote, not lose one plant under his presidency. Then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stalances in Detroit. Thousands of Michigan auto workers lost their jobs. And if he wins again, we can expect there would be more of the same. Because we know what he has done. And we know that we're going to focus on the work, not the words when it comes to Donald Trump. And we know where he took us the last time.",chunk_5,374
2024-10-18,Event,"Harris held campaign event in Lansing, Grand Rapids",chunk,"And check this out, Donald Trump's current running man, because you know the job is open, right? You know, like when people go for an interview, especially the young people, they'll go for an interview and they'll sit down and they're in the interview and they'll say, why is the job open? Well, we know why that job was open. So Donald Trump's running mate recently suggested that if they win, they would threaten the Grand River Assembly plant right here in Lansing. The same plant that with your help, our administration protected earlier this year, say thanks to St. Henry and his family. And I'm going to leave some of the union workers from Grand River here with us today. So you know what I'm talking about. And Donald Trump's running mate called your jobs table scraps, right? So let me just say, needless to say, I will always have your back. And we'll keep fighting to make sure that you keep your jobs right here in Lansing and keep these most noble and important jobs for America's strength. That's the work you all do. You know, Donald Trump, he also promised that he was going to stop off-shoring. Remember that? Then he cut taxes for corporations that shipped 200,000 jobs overseas during his presidency. Cut the taxes for those corporations. And awarded nearly half a trillion dollars in federal contracts to companies that were off-shoring jobs. All of the money. He gave your tax dollars to companies that were sending your jobs overseas. And we got to get the word out to all of the brothers and sisters in labor to remind them of what this dude does. Right? What the actual he does. Because make no mistake, Donald Trump is no friend to labor. He is no friend to labor. And we got to listen to what he says. Know that you know that famous saying, listen when people tell you who they are. In fact, can we roll the clip? Let's see. Here we go. He's in a hate debate over time. When I was at the private sectors they said, oh, I don't want over at United. I shouldn't tell you this. I'd go out and get other people out of work regular time.",chunk_6,379

They get away with murder because they say, oh yes, we're building a cell. They take them out of a box and they assemble them. We could have our child. They go, I can easily, that's okay. You're all gone. You're all gone. The United Auto Workers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen. And the leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately. So of course that last bit he was talking about Sean Faye, who represents nearly a million active and retired auto workers. Okay, so that's about a million auto workers active and retired. Donald Trump, listen to his words. He's saying that auto workers are essentially engaged in child's play. That children can do it. Listen to what he says. I'm telling you, he's got his club. And I'm going to tell you, union workers are not part of his club. Let's be clear about that. No matter what he does in his rallies, let's be clear about that. Right? He thinks that the value of your work is essentially meaningless. That's what he's saying to compare it to child's work. When we here know the work you do is complex, you do it with great care. You work hard. You are highly skilled. You are highly trained. And the best auto workers in the world is who you are. And the fact is Donald Trump's comments are the time someone who has had everything handed to him. I know it's right. It is. I know it is. This man, you know, who never had to work a job that came with countless hands or an hourly wage, right? Someone who got handed $400 million on a silver platter and did what with it five bankruptcy six times. Come on. Come on. He will never understand the life and the work of a United Auto Worker. He will never understand that. People who work hard for everything they have, who take great pride in a job well done, who understand what it represents to their family and the future of their family. Again, I go back to the dignity of hard work. So let us be clear. Donald Trump's insults to American workers is not exclusive to that video, okay? So that was just a moment.",chunk_7,395
2024-10-18,Event,"Harris held campaign event in Lansing, Grand Rapids",chunk,"Kind of think of it as the commercial break in my speech. But his comments are not only that, because Donald Trump has been a union buster his entire career. He has called union leaders quote, doosucking people. Okay? He said that he supports so-called right to work laws quote, 100%. Okay? He bragged and joked with a billionaire buddy about mass firing striking workers and lowered labor standards and made it easier for companies that break the laws to get federal contracts. Donald Trump encouraged automakers of Michigan so they could pay their workers less, encourage them to move so they could pay their workers less. Okay? And when the UAW went on strike to demand the higher wages you deserve, Donald Trump went to a non-union shop and attacked the UAW. He said striking and collective bargaining don't make it, I'm going to quote, a damn bit of difference. So here's the bottom line. Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people. And he is, I believe, an existential threat to America's labor movement. And everything he intends to do if he is re-elected is also spelled out in that project 2025. So to read it and to know what it is to know, he intends to launch a full-on attack on unions and the freedom to organize. Okay? So he will ban public sector unions, roll back workplace safety protections, read it when you have some time, Google it, everybody's watching. Look, he will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay for workers and appoint a union buster to run the Department of Labor. Be sure of that. Be sure of that. All right, all friends here, I say what you already know. It's time to turn the page. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back.

Thank you! Thank you! Alright, okay, thank you and we need to get to work. Alright, thank you all. It is so good to be back in Michigan! It is so good to be back. I want to thank everyone for taking the time out of your busy lives to take the time to be here this evening. I thank you all so very much. Can we please hear for Senator Stabenow who was here earlier? Can we hear for Executive Dave Coulter, Representative Stevens who we need to elect to the United States Congress and let's send Representative Slokkin to the United States Senate? Because we need them in D.C. I also want to thank all of the leaders of the Arab American community who are here. As everyone knows, this community has deep and proud roots in the Detroit metro area and I am proud to have the support of Arab American leaders like Wayne County, Deputy, we need a medic. Let's figure out a way to part a little bit so that we can bring a medic in over here please. Okay, it looks like we need a medic over there too. Is that what we're saying? Okay, we got a lot of folks in here, it's a little warm. Let's just make sure we're looking out for each other, okay? Are we okay? All right, it looks like we're good. We're okay? All right. Okay, thank you. And always to our first responders, thank you for your work. So as I was saying, our Arab American community has deep and proud roots in the Detroit metro area and I am very proud to have the support of Arab American leaders like Wayne County, Executive Asad Turfi. And listen, I know this year has been very difficult. Given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza, and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon, it is devastating and now, Omar's death can and must be a turning point. Everyone must seize this opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza, bring the hostages home, and end the suffering once and for all. And I continue to believe diplomacy is the answer to bringing lasting stability across the Israel-Lebanon border. And as Vice President and with your help as President, I will do everything in my power to achieve these goals and work toward a future with security and dignity for all people in the region. So thank you all. And Michigan, listen, we got 18 days to get this done. 18 short days. And you all wouldn't be here spending your precious time here with all the other obligations you've got if you did not know this is probably one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And it's going to be a tight race until the very end. And we are the underdog and running as the underdog, but make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We will win. Yes, we will. We will win. And we will win because we understand, and we will win because we understand what is at stake. This election is about two very different visions for our nation. One, Donald Trump's that is focused on the past. And the other, and the other ours that is focused on the future. We are focused on a future where we bring down the cost of living, invest in small businesses and entrepreneurs, protect reproductive freedom. That is in the future that we are fighting for. But as you all know, that's not what we're hearing from Donald Trump. Instead, it is the same old tired playbook. He has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people. No plan. Can I hear it again? No plan. And he is only focused on himself. And now, check this out, he is ducking debates and canceling interviews. You saw his own campaign team is saying it's because of exhaustion. All right, well, here's the thing. If you are exhausted from the campaign trail, it raises real questions about you are fit for the toughest job in the world. And so, folks, for these reasons and more, it is time to turn the page. It's turned the page because America is ready to chart a new way forward, ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership that is all of you, is all of us. Which is why Democrats, Republicans, independents are supporting our campaign. In fact, you may have seen earlier this week over 100 Republican leaders from across the country joined me on the campaign trail. Including some who served under Donald Trump's administration. Because, you know, they know him best. They understand what's at stake. And I believe Americans want a president and deserve a president who works for all the American people. All the American people. And that has been, as you all know, the story of my entire career. I've only in my career had one client, the people. One client. As a young courtroom prosecutor, I've protected women and children. As Attorney General of California, I fought for students and veterans who were being scammed by those for-profit colleges. As Vice President, I have stood up for workers and seniors. And as President, I will fight for all the American people, always. Always. And together, us and you, we will together. Like, I want you to shout your own name for a minute. Let's do that really quickly. Shout your own name for a minute. That's what I'm talking about, because it's about you. It's about your family. It's about you. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. Because together, we will build a brighter future for our nation. Together. Together. A future where we build what I call an opportunity economy. So that every American has an opportunity to own a home, buy a car, build wealth, start a business. Right? Under my plan, we will deal with things like bringing down the cost of housing. We will help entrepreneurs start and grow a small business. Do we have any small business owners here? Yeah. Our small businesses are the backbone of America's economy. My plan will expand Medicare to cover home healthcare for seniors. And look, as with so many of the issues that are priority issues for me, including small businesses, the issue of home healthcare, look, I'm going to just go off script for a moment. So when my mother was sick, I took care of her. And for anyone here who has or is taking care of an older relative, you know what it is. It's about trying to cook something that they feel like eating. It's about trying to put some clothes on them that won't irritate their skin. Right? It's about from time to time trying to figure out what you can say that will bring a smile to their face or make them laugh. It's about dignity. It's about dignity. And here's the deal. When you look at everyone who is doing that and then you look at what we call the sandwich generation, which are people who are raising your young children and taking care of your parents, it's a lot. And either you have enough money to afford to have somebody come in and help you, which most people don't, or you might have to give up your job, which means you're cutting off a source of income for your household, or you have to spend down your savings to qualify for Medicaid. That's just not right. So my plan is to say that we are going to fix it so that Medicare covers the cost of home healthcare work for seniors. Because it's about dignity. It's about dignity so more seniors can live at home with dignity. Our plan will lower costs on everything from healthcare to groceries. I'm going to take on corporate price gouging like I've done before. I'm going to do it again. My plan will also give middle class tax cuts to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life, because here is where I'm coming from. The vast majority of our young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources. And so looking at expanding the child tax credit, again, it's about dignity. It's about recognizing that folks just need a little help to buy a car seat or a crib, or the essential needs for your child during such a critical stage of their development. And by the way, we all benefit from that. Everybody benefits from that. So these are just some examples of our plan and all of that to say, look, I will always, I will always stand and fight for the middle class and working families of America. I come from the middle class and I will never forget where I come from. My plan also invests in American manufacturing and innovation. And I will make sure America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century. USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! And Michigan knows better than most what that means about investing in American industry. Under my plan, we will invest in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, and the great American auto industry. And contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive. But here's what I will do. I will invest in communities like Oakland County and Detroit. We will retool existing factories and hire locally and work with unions to create good-paying jobs, including, by the way, jobs that do not require a college degree, because this is how I feel. Look, this is how I feel about that. We all know a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a qualified worker. So part of my plan is to do an assessment of all the federal jobs, which will be under our jurisdiction, to figure out which of them should be rethought of in terms of whether or not it actually requires a college degree. And the next step on that is going to be to challenge the private sector to do the same. I will also protect the pensions of union members and retirees, including yesterday when I announced the protection of the full-earned pension benefits of more than 22,500 retirees under the Detroit Carpenters Pension Fund. Because back to the point about dignity, I understand the dignity of work and I understand the importance of having dignity in your retirement. Now Donald Trump has a different approach. I don't need to tell you he's full of big promises, but always fails to deliver. Always fails to deliver. So remember he said he was the only one, you know how he talks, the only one, who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs. Remember when he said that? And then America lost almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president, including tens of thousands of jobs right here in Michigan. And those losses started before the pandemic, okay? Making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history. And his track record for the auto industry was also a disaster. He promised workers in Warren, remember he promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, and I'm going to quote, not lose one plant during his presidency. Then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit. Remember that? Thousands, thousands of Michigan auto workers lost their jobs. And Donald Trump's running mate, you know, because the position was vacant and he had to fill it, right? You know for the young people here, you know when you go for an interview and you sit down at the interview and you ask the person who's interviewing, why is the job vacant? So Donald Trump's current running mate recently suggested that if they win, they would threaten the Grand River Assembly plant in Lansing. The same plant that our administration protected earlier this year saving 650 union jobs. And remember, Donald Trump encouraged automakers to move their plants out of Michigan so they could pay their workers less. And when the UAW went on strike, when the UAW went on strike to demand the higher wages that you deserved, Donald Trump went to a non-union shop. Remember? And he attacked the UAW. And he said striking, he said striking and collective bargaining don't, and I'm going to quote, don't make a damn bit of difference. That's what he said about striking and collective bargaining. Well Michigan, you know better, we know better. Strong unions mean higher wages, better healthcare and greater dignity for union members and everyone else. Because you don't have to be a member of a union to thank unions for your five day work week and your vacation time and your sick leave. Thank a union. Which is why when I am president with your help, I will sign the pro act into law and make it easier for workers to join a union and negotiate for better pay and working conditions. And now Donald Trump is making the same empty promises to the people of Michigan that he did before, hoping you will forget how he let you down the last time. But we're not falling for the Okie Doe. No. And we won't be fooled. Just for example, Google Project 2025. Which I still by the way find it fascinating to think that they actually put that in writing. I mean they put it in writing, they published it, they bound it and gave it out. Right? And here's the thing. To read it is to know it is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts. Cut Social Security and Medicare. Get rid of the $35 cap on insulin for seniors that you all helped us get. Make it easier. He will read it and make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay to workers. And he intends to impose what I call a Trump sales tax which is at least 20% if not more of a tax on everyday basic necessities which economists have estimated will cost the American family an additional $4,000 a year. And if that weren't enough on top of this and all of this, he plans to end the Affordable Care Act. And he has no plan to replace it. Because he has quote, concepts of a plan. So you all have heard me say, you know, I think Donald Trump is an unserious man. And the consequences if he would ever get back into the White House are absolutely dangerously serious. Because think about it, he's going to threaten the health insurance coverage of 45, okay. So here's the thing. Here's the thing about that. Here's the thing about that. The courts are going to take care of that. We're going to take care of November. We're going to take care of November. How about that? Right? We'll take care of November. But again, concepts of a plan. So think about it in terms of the serious nature of this. He's basically threatening the health insurance coverage of 45 million Americans based on a concept and taking us back to when you remember insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was? And that's why we are not going back. We are not going back. No, we are not going back. We will move forward. We will move forward. Because ours is a fight for the future. Ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we are, we remember how we got here, right? Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade and they did as he intended. And now check this out. In America, one in three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exception even for rape and incest. Which means you're telling someone who is a survivor of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next? That is immoral, immoral. And let us agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. Not the government. Not the government. No. If she chooses she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her emomb, but not the government and some folks up in a state house telling her what's in her own best interest. And so here's my pledge to you. When Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it in July. And across our nation, listen, I'm traveling the country and I'll tell you across our nation, we are witnessing a full on assault on hard won freedoms and rights, including the freedom to vote. Let me tell you, in places like Georgia where I'm spending some time, you know they passed the bill. And I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States of America.

Thank you! Thank you! Alright, okay, thank you and we need to get to work. Alright, thank you all. It is so good to be back in Michigan! It is so good to be back. I want to thank everyone for taking the time out of your busy lives to take the time to be here this evening. I thank you all so very much. Can we please hear for Senator Stabenow who was here earlier? Can we hear for Executive Dave Coulter, Representative Stevens who we need to elect to the United States Congress and let's send Representative Slokkin to the United States Senate? Because we need them in D.C. I also want to thank all of the leaders of the Arab American community who are here. As everyone knows, this community has deep and proud roots in the Detroit metro area and I am proud to have the support of Arab American leaders like Wayne County, Deputy, we need a medic. Let's figure out a way to part a little bit so that we can bring a medic in over here please. Okay, it looks like we need a medic over there too. Is that what we're saying? Okay, we got a lot of folks in here, it's a little warm. Let's just make sure we're looking out for each other, okay? Are we okay? All right, it looks like we're good. We're okay? All right. Okay, thank you. And always to our first responders, thank you for your work. So as I was saying, our Arab American community has deep and proud roots in the Detroit metro area and I am very proud to have the support of Arab American leaders like Wayne County, Executive Asad Turfi. And listen, I know this year has been very difficult. Given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza, and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon, it is devastating and now, Omar's death can and must be a turning point. Everyone must seize this opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza, bring the hostages home, and end the suffering once and for all. And I continue to believe diplomacy is the answer to bringing lasting stability across the Israel-Lebanon border.",chunk_1,394
2024-10-18,Rally,"Harris held campaign event in Lansing, Grand Rapids",chunk,"And as Vice President and with your help as President, I will do everything in my power to achieve these goals and work toward a future with security and dignity for all people in the region. So thank you all. And Michigan, listen, we got 18 days to get this done. 18 short days. And you all wouldn't be here spending your precious time here with all the other obligations you've got if you did not know this is probably one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And it's going to be a tight race until the very end. And we are the underdog and running as the underdog, but make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We will win. Yes, we will. We will win. And we will win because we understand, and we will win because we understand what is at stake. This election is about two very different visions for our nation. One, Donald Trump's that is focused on the past. And the other, and the other ours that is focused on the future. We are focused on a future where we bring down the cost of living, invest in small businesses and entrepreneurs, protect reproductive freedom. That is in the future that we are fighting for. But as you all know, that's not what we're hearing from Donald Trump. Instead, it is the same old tired playbook. He has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people. No plan. Can I hear it again? No plan. And he is only focused on himself. And now, check this out, he is ducking debates and canceling interviews. You saw his own campaign team is saying it's because of exhaustion. All right, well, here's the thing. If you are exhausted from the campaign trail, it raises real questions about you are fit for the toughest job in the world. And so, folks, for these reasons and more, it is time to turn the page. It's turned the page because America is ready to chart a new way forward, ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership that is all of you, is all of us. Which is why Democrats, Republicans, independents are supporting our campaign. In fact, you may have seen earlier this week over 100 Republican leaders from across the country joined me on the campaign trail.",chunk_2,399
2024-10-18,Rally,"Harris held campaign event in Lansing, Grand Rapids",chunk,"Including some who served under Donald Trump's administration. Because, you know, they know him best. They understand what's at stake. And I believe Americans want a president and deserve a president who works for all the American people. All the American people. And that has been, as you all know, the story of my entire career. I've only in my career had one client, the people. One client. As a young courtroom prosecutor, I've protected women and children. As Attorney General of California, I fought for students and veterans who were being scammed by those for-profit colleges. As Vice President, I have stood up for workers and seniors. And as President, I will fight for all the American people, always. Always. And together, us and you, we will together. Like, I want you to shout your own name for a minute. Let's do that really quickly. Shout your own name for a minute. That's what I'm talking about, because it's about you. It's about your family. It's about you. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. Because together, we will build a brighter future for our nation. Together. Together. A future where we build what I call an opportunity economy. So that every American has an opportunity to own a home, buy a car, build wealth, start a business. Right? Under my plan, we will deal with things like bringing down the cost of housing. We will help entrepreneurs start and grow a small business. Do we have any small business owners here? Yeah. Our small businesses are the backbone of America's economy. My plan will expand Medicare to cover home healthcare for seniors. And look, as with so many of the issues that are priority issues for me, including small businesses, the issue of home healthcare, look, I'm going to just go off script for a moment. So when my mother was sick, I took care of her. And for anyone here who has or is taking care of an older relative, you know what it is. It's about trying to cook something that they feel like eating. It's about trying to put some clothes on them that won't irritate their skin.",chunk_3,366
2024-10-18,Rally,"Harris held campaign event in Lansing, Grand Rapids",chunk,"Right? It's about from time to time trying to figure out what you can say that will bring a smile to their face or make them laugh. It's about dignity. It's about dignity. And here's the deal. When you look at everyone who is doing that and then you look at what we call the sandwich generation, which are people who are raising your young children and taking care of your parents, it's a lot. And either you have enough money to afford to have somebody come in and help you, which most people don't, or you might have to give up your job, which means you're cutting off a source of income for your household, or you have to spend down your savings to qualify for Medicaid. That's just not right. So my plan is to say that we are going to fix it so that Medicare covers the cost of home healthcare work for seniors. Because it's about dignity. It's about dignity so more seniors can live at home with dignity. Our plan will lower costs on everything from healthcare to groceries. I'm going to take on corporate price gouging like I've done before. I'm going to do it again. My plan will also give middle class tax cuts to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life, because here is where I'm coming from. The vast majority of our young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources. And so looking at expanding the child tax credit, again, it's about dignity. It's about recognizing that folks just need a little help to buy a car seat or a crib, or the essential needs for your child during such a critical stage of their development. And by the way, we all benefit from that. Everybody benefits from that. So these are just some examples of our plan and all of that to say, look, I will always, I will always stand and fight for the middle class and working families of America. I come from the middle class and I will never forget where I come from. My plan also invests in American manufacturing and innovation. And I will make sure America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century.",chunk_4,385
2024-10-18,Rally,"Harris held campaign event in Lansing, Grand Rapids",chunk,"USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! And Michigan knows better than most what that means about investing in American industry. Under my plan, we will invest in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, and the great American auto industry. And contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive. But here's what I will do. I will invest in communities like Oakland County and Detroit. We will retool existing factories and hire locally and work with unions to create good-paying jobs, including, by the way, jobs that do not require a college degree, because this is how I feel. Look, this is how I feel about that. We all know a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a qualified worker. So part of my plan is to do an assessment of all the federal jobs, which will be under our jurisdiction, to figure out which of them should be rethought of in terms of whether or not it actually requires a college degree. And the next step on that is going to be to challenge the private sector to do the same. I will also protect the pensions of union members and retirees, including yesterday when I announced the protection of the full-earned pension benefits of more than 22,500 retirees under the Detroit Carpenters Pension Fund. Because back to the point about dignity, I understand the dignity of work and I understand the importance of having dignity in your retirement. Now Donald Trump has a different approach. I don't need to tell you he's full of big promises, but always fails to deliver. Always fails to deliver. So remember he said he was the only one, you know how he talks, the only one, who could bring back America's manufacturing jobs. Remember when he said that? And then America lost almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president, including tens of thousands of jobs right here in Michigan. And those losses started before the pandemic, okay? Making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history.",chunk_5,359
2024-10-18,Rally,"Harris held campaign event in Lansing, Grand Rapids",chunk,"And his track record for the auto industry was also a disaster. He promised workers in Warren, remember he promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, and I'm going to quote, not lose one plant during his presidency. Then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit. Remember that? Thousands, thousands of Michigan auto workers lost their jobs. And Donald Trump's running mate, you know, because the position was vacant and he had to fill it, right? You know for the young people here, you know when you go for an interview and you sit down at the interview and you ask the person who's interviewing, why is the job vacant? So Donald Trump's current running mate recently suggested that if they win, they would threaten the Grand River Assembly plant in Lansing. The same plant that our administration protected earlier this year saving 650 union jobs. And remember, Donald Trump encouraged automakers to move their plants out of Michigan so they could pay their workers less. And when the UAW went on strike, when the UAW went on strike to demand the higher wages that you deserved, Donald Trump went to a non-union shop. Remember? And he attacked the UAW. And he said striking, he said striking and collective bargaining don't, and I'm going to quote, don't make a damn bit of difference. That's what he said about striking and collective bargaining. Well Michigan, you know better, we know better. Strong unions mean higher wages, better healthcare and greater dignity for union members and everyone else. Because you don't have to be a member of a union to thank unions for your five day work week and your vacation time and your sick leave. Thank a union. Which is why when I am president with your help, I will sign the pro act into law and make it easier for workers to join a union and negotiate for better pay and working conditions. And now Donald Trump is making the same empty promises to the people of Michigan that he did before, hoping you will forget how he let you down the last time.",chunk_6,371
2024-10-18,Rally,"Harris held campaign event in Lansing, Grand Rapids",chunk,"But we're not falling for the Okie Doe. No. And we won't be fooled. Just for example, Google Project 2025. Which I still by the way find it fascinating to think that they actually put that in writing. I mean they put it in writing, they published it, they bound it and gave it out. Right? And here's the thing. To read it is to know it is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts. Cut Social Security and Medicare. Get rid of the $35 cap on insulin for seniors that you all helped us get. Make it easier. He will read it and make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay to workers. And he intends to impose what I call a Trump sales tax which is at least 20% if not more of a tax on everyday basic necessities which economists have estimated will cost the American family an additional $4,000 a year. And if that weren't enough on top of this and all of this, he plans to end the Affordable Care Act. And he has no plan to replace it. Because he has quote, concepts of a plan. So you all have heard me say, you know, I think Donald Trump is an unserious man. And the consequences if he would ever get back into the White House are absolutely dangerously serious. Because think about it, he's going to threaten the health insurance coverage of 45, okay. So here's the thing. Here's the thing about that. Here's the thing about that. The courts are going to take care of that. We're going to take care of November. We're going to take care of November. How about that? Right? We'll take care of November. But again, concepts of a plan. So think about it in terms of the serious nature of this. He's basically threatening the health insurance coverage of 45 million Americans based on a concept and taking us back to when you remember insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was? And that's why we are not going back. We are not going back. No, we are not going back. We will move forward.",chunk_7,383
2024-10-18,Rally,"Harris held campaign event in Lansing, Grand Rapids",chunk,"We will move forward. Because ours is a fight for the future. Ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we are, we remember how we got here, right? Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade and they did as he intended. And now check this out. In America, one in three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exception even for rape and incest. Which means you're telling someone who is a survivor of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next? That is immoral, immoral. And let us agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. Not the government. Not the government. No. If she chooses she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her emomb, but not the government and some folks up in a state house telling her what's in her own best interest. And so here's my pledge to you. When Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it in July. And across our nation, listen, I'm traveling the country and I'll tell you across our nation, we are witnessing a full on assault on hard won freedoms and rights, including the freedom to vote. Let me tell you, in places like Georgia where I'm spending some time, you know they passed the bill.",chunk_8,311

We're ready to get out there and get everyone to vote! And the mic is not on now, so... Hey, Detroit, are we ready? Yeah! So before I came out, my team was telling me, and I was talking to some members of the press, and they said, hey, since early voting has started, can you hear me? You can't hear me. They can't hear me. Okay, I'm gonna... I didn't want to stand right here. Okay, can you hear me now? Okay. Okay. There we go. So my team was telling me, so, you know, George has started early voting, and they broke historic records in early voting. North Carolina started early voting, broke historic records in North Carolina. Now who is the capital of producing records? Yeah! So we are gonna break some records here in Detroit today. Yes, we are. We are going to do this, because we know what is at stake, and we know the power of the people. This is about the power of the people. This is about knowing each one of us as an individual, and as a collective, as a community, as a coalition. We have the power to make the decisions about the direction of our country, and we know this election is about two very different visions for our future. Ours focused on the future, focused on our young leaders, focused on possibility, understanding the ambitions and the aspirations and the dreams of the American people, understanding like the people of Detroit. We have grit, we have excellence, we have history. And it's about looking in the face of a perfect stranger and seeing a neighbor, and understanding we are all in this together. We all have so much more in common than what separates us, and we are gonna fight for this country we love. We are in this to win it. And we know, look, race is tight is gonna be hard work, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work, and we will win. And we will win. So you all are here taking time out of your busy lives and all your other obligations, and I thank you so very much. And I know what today is. We're here because this is a working day. We're ready to get out there. We're ready to walk the neighborhood. We are ready to talk with our neighbors and our friends and just the people that we see and remind them they are important, and that we are so optimistic about our new generation of leadership for America and what we will do together. That is about investing in working people, in middle-class people, in our children, what we do in terms of caring about the education of our children, which is why we're not falling for the other guy trying to get rid of the Department of Education and help start. Because we know what we stand for. We stand for the idea that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it's on who you lift up. And these are the things that we stand for as a community of people that understand the importance of caring and kindness, who understand the importance of having a leader who speaks truth and is not so self-consuming. I keep talking about it, somebody needs to just watch his rallies if you're not really sure how to vote. Because he spends full-time talking about himself and mythical characters, not talking about the working people, not talking about you, not talking about lifting you up. And so as we spend these next 17 days, we're going to go vote today, we're going to remind people to vote, we're going to register folks to vote, we're going to email text, phone call, knock on doors, we're going to remind people of what is at stake, and with that I want to thank incredible leaders from Michigan who are here, the Lieutenant Governor, Garling Gilgast. He always stands above the crowd. We have Representative Swatkin who is here and we will send to the Senate in November. Representative Thundar who is here, Wayne County Executive Evans, Mayor Duggan, and all of the National Labor Union presidents who are here. And let's not forget the most phenomenal Lizzo. So to everyone who's here, I'm not going to spend any more time on this stage because we got work to do. We have 17 days to get this done and we're not going to be able, we're never going to be able to get these 17 days back and what I think we all know is on election day we don't want to have any regrets about what we could have done these next 17 days. And on November 5th and at the end of that day we're going to look at each other and we're going to say yes, the power was with the people and we made a difference and that's the beauty of who we are as a nation. We know we can make a difference because the power is with the people. Have a nice day. Thank you. I'll see you out there. Thank you all.",full,902

We're ready to get out there and get everyone to vote! And the mic is not on now, so.. Hey, Detroit, are we ready? Yeah! So before I came out, my team was telling me, and I was talking to some members of the press, and they said, hey, since early voting has started, can you hear me? You can't hear me. They can't hear me. Okay, I'm gonna.. I didn't want to stand right here. Okay, can you hear me now? Okay. Okay. There we go. So my team was telling me, so, you know, George has started early voting, and they broke historic records in early voting. North Carolina started early voting, broke historic records in North Carolina. Now who is the capital of producing records? Yeah! So we are gonna break some records here in Detroit today. Yes, we are. We are going to do this, because we know what is at stake, and we know the power of the people. This is about the power of the people. This is about knowing each one of us as an individual, and as a collective, as a community, as a coalition. We have the power to make the decisions about the direction of our country, and we know this election is about two very different visions for our future. Ours focused on the future, focused on our young leaders, focused on possibility, understanding the ambitions and the aspirations and the dreams of the American people, understanding like the people of Detroit. We have grit, we have excellence, we have history. And it's about looking in the face of a perfect stranger and seeing a neighbor, and understanding we are all in this together. We all have so much more in common than what separates us, and we are gonna fight for this country we love. We are in this to win it. And we know, look, race is tight is gonna be hard work, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work, and we will win. And we will win.

2024-10-20,Event,"Kamala Harris delivers remarks at Divine Faith Ministries in Jonesboro, Georgia ",full,"Thank you for warmly receiving me and so many of us who joined you this afternoon to thank you and the congregation and First Lady for all the work that you are doing and for getting folks out to the polls today. I've been in Jordan today. I was earlier, we were in fellowship with a pastor who flew out from San Francisco, Dr. Amacy Brown, the Rappin Church in San Francisco. We were all together this morning. And I have to say that I do know that we have all been raised in the church to understand faith is a verb. It is about what we know and can believe despite what we see, but it also is something that is going to manifest itself in our actions, our deeds and our service. And I know everyone here today, this afternoon, is committed to doing just that and this is an afternoon that is about faith and action. And pastor, I have to say, there is so much at stake right now. And when we think about how we have learned and have understood and lived, then I'll just say ours is a love of God. And that we understand that for us to do good works, it means to do it in the spirit of understanding that our strength is not based on who we be now and someone try and suggest, our strength is based on who we lift up. And that spirit is very much at stake in these next 16 days, which is our real country that honors through our faith and our deeds the importance of kindness, of support, of understanding the dignity in each other, the respect that we should have for each other. You know, we know in terms of the parable of the good Samaritan that we have learned in such little life where in the face of a stranger we see a neighbor. But that's not what we see on the other side of this equation and isolation. It is constantly about burying people and believing people and making call to them. And I think we at faith, we who believe in our country and love our country, know that we each as individuals and as a community have the power to make decisions through these next 16 days that will be about a statement about what kind of country we would want to live in. And is ours a country where the people will speak their word, the power of the people will make the statement that ours is a country that fueled by our faith, is about doing things that are focused on putting the best interest of our children, our families, giving people the resources they need around assistance, helping people pull out of poverty those who want to work hard or are working hard but deserve to be seen and uplifted. And these are the issues in this election. I offer as an example one of the things that I am very focused on is what we need to do to take care of our elders. So as a personal experience I will share with you what a mama needs to say, she passed her cancer. And I know this is pink Sunday for many of us who are acknowledging what we need to do to fight breast cancer. So mama she did research in breast cancer and she is one of the very few who actually, a woman of color who is doing this work, but mama will say I took care of her. And for anyone who is taking care of an elder in your family, parent, grandparent, you know what that is. It's about trying to cook something that they'll feel like eating. It's about trying to give them the clothes that won't irritate their skin to help them to put on a sweater. It's about trying to figure out something you can say that puts a smile to their face. It gives them a reason to laugh. It's about dignity. It's about dignity. So part of how I think about what we need to do in the future of our country is to really have policies that are about sharing and giving and recognizing dignity. Which is why part of my plan is that instead of having you have to either leave your job to take care of an elder in your family, or try to pull together the money to afford to bring somebody in, or worse yet have to reduce all of your savings to qualify for Medicaid. I'm going to talk about it. So, understanding about dignity, part of my plan is that we are going to have Medicare cover the cost of in-home healthcare for our seniors. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. They have Steve, one of himself, say, be happy. Alright, true fast. So we decide now. La la la. La la la. La la la. La la la.",full,835

Brown of Third Baptist Church of San Francisco who you heard from earlier this morning and whose wisdom Dr. Brown has guided me and just been a source of comfort and solace for me for so many years and I'm especially glad to be here on Pink Sunday as some of you may know my mother was a breast cancer researcher she was one of the very few women and fewer even women of color who was engaged in studying breast cancer and she had two goals in her life to raise her two daughters my sister Maya and me and to end breast cancer it was her life's work and so today of course then has personal significance for me just as I know it does for Pastor Brian and and so many of you here and so to everyone here today who knows what it means to support a loved one through a cancer diagnosis and treatment and to those of you fighting your own battles I am holding you close in my heart and in my prayers and I thank you for your courage and your strength so all of this is to say it is so good to be here with everyone today and to worship with you and on this day then I am reminded with everything that we reflect on on the parable from the Gospel of Luke so in the gospel we are told of a man who traveled from the road from Jerusalem to Jericho and while traveling he was attacked by robbers we remember he was beaten he was bloodied they left him for dead he was someone that should just be passed on by maybe with a glance of pity but not more so one person passed by sees the man lying in his path and walks around him not wanting to be bothered or obstructed on the path that he decided to walk a second man does the same but then a Samaritan walks by he sees the man and he stops the Samaritan bandages the strangers wounds he brings him to an inn gives him shelter and a hot meal and he saves the man's life this parable the parable of the Good Samaritan teaches us to love thy neighbor as thyself these words are simple we know them well it is an essential tenant and a pillar of our faith and that of so many others however one must ask are all people of faith living those words are all people of faith expressing those words in their actions do we have leaders in place who understand that in the face of a stranger one should see a neighbor and I'll tell you I grew up in a church that took those words to heart as a little girl on Sundays my sister mine I would go to 23rd Avenue Church of God in Oakland California where we sang in the children's choir we attended Sunday school and we're after church we will go to the basement and eat a food prepared by loving hands and where I first learned the teachings of the Bible and my earliest memories of those teachings are about a loving God a loving God a God who asks us to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves and to defend the rights of the poor and the needy and for me like for so many of us church is then a place of growth and belonging and community a place where we are reminded of the incredible power of faith and fellowship and fellowship and in moments of difficulty and uncertainty when the way is not clear it is our faith that then guides us forward faith in what we often cannot see but we know to be true faith in what we cannot see but know to be true and I say that because in this moment across our nation what we do see are some who tried to deepen division among us spread hate so fear and cause chaos there are those who suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we know which is the true measure of the strength of the leader is based on who you lift up and this moment in our nation must be about so much more than partisan politics it must be about looking inward and being guided by our faith to know what brings hope and what is truly the best expression of our strength in the way that we reach out to each other with kindness and with love and with sincerity in that approach this is a moment that is challenging us a faith to reflect on this moment in the context of our future we just applauded the young leaders who are here this morning and I think so much of this moment in the context of them are young leaders and what they have a right to expect and what their faith teaches them that gives them rightly a sense of hope about where they belong who they are and what they can be and so this is a moment that is challenging I think our fundamental values and challenging us as Americans and as people of faith and as the Good Samaritan reminds us it is not enough to preach the values of compassion and respect we must live them faith is a verb faith is a verb we show it in action in our deeds and in our service here in Georgia we've seen it playing out in real time in just the last many weeks where communities have come together in the wake of Hurricane Helene right here in the Atlanta area I saw the story of a reporter who was outside covering the storm live on television when he heard some screams everything waited into just deep water to rescue a woman in her car carrying her on his back to safety in a town a few hours from here one mother and her children lost power for days and as soon as it was restored they started a relief drive distributing food water and supplies and opened their home to neighbors in need of laundry or a hot shower on a visit recently to Augusta I met people who themselves had experienced extraordinary loss and devastation many who did not have electricity or running water yet every day they left their homes to go to relief centers to help perfect strangers so what we have seen here in Georgia and in other states is faith in action individuals who know their power to shed light in a moment of darkness we have seen the good Samaritans walking among us and for that reason I say as the scripture tells us we then must remember that and not be weary let us not be weary in moments like this let us focus on what God shows us about the good Samaritans walking among us to remind us of the power the agency the ability and dare I say the duty that we have to come to another's aid in moments of need to love thy neighbor and what God is showing us is that any of us can do that no matter who we are and I know and I learned this at a young age and I'll share with you a quick story so during my final year of law school I was a summer intern in the DA's office in Oakland California and I was working in the Superior Courthouse and there was this one case that I got and it was it involved a drug bust and the police had arrested a number of people including an innocent bystander a woman who had been in the wrong place at the wrong time and when I got the case it was a late Friday afternoon and most folks had gone home for the weekend and I knew in all likelihood the judge would probably not see her case until that following Monday which would have meant that she would have had to spend the whole weekend in jail now this woman had children she is a mother she had children at home and I wondered if they even knew that their mother had been arrested who would take care of them if she could not would child protective services come and take those children everything was on the line for that woman so I rushed to the clerk of the court and asked them to have the case called that day and then when that did not work I pleaded with them remember I was not vice president I was an intern so yes I pleaded and finally the judge returned to the bench and reviewed her case and with a pound of his gavel she was free to go home and she would go home to see her children and take care of them and I never did get the chance to meet that woman but I will never forget that moment and I share that story to say that we have all in our lives from the earliest stages of our lives had those moments where it has been revealed to us our power and we should never let anyone take our power from us or in any way try to convince us we are powerless and so I say as we move forward let us look at where we are and understand the lesson of the gospel of Luke because right now each of us has an opportunity to make a difference in this moment our country is at a crossroads and where we go from here is up to us as Americans and as people of faith and now we ask a question we face this question what kind of country do we want to live in a country of chaos fear and hate or a country of freedom compassion and justice and the great thing about living in a democracy is that we the people have the power to answer that question so let us answer not just through our words but through our action and with our votes when we come across our brothers and sisters in need let us as the good Samaritan did see in the face of a stranger a neighbor and let us recognize that when we shine the light in moments of darkness it will guide our feet into the path of peace and let us remember that while weeping may endure for a night joy coming in the morning thank you may God bless you may God bless the United States of America thank you all very much,full,2345

is a moment that is challenging I think our fundamental values and challenging us as Americans and as people of faith and as the Good Samaritan reminds us it is not enough to preach the values of compassion and respect we must live them faith is a verb faith is a verb we show it in action in our deeds and in our service here in Georgia we've seen it playing out in real time in just the last many weeks where communities have come together in the wake of Hurricane Helene right here in the Atlanta area I saw the story of a reporter who was outside covering the storm live on television when he heard some screams everything waited into just deep water to rescue a woman in her car carrying her on his back to safety in a town a few hours from here one mother and her children lost power for days and as soon as it was restored they started a relief drive distributing food water and supplies and opened their home to neighbors in need of laundry or a hot shower on a visit recently to Augusta I met people who themselves had experienced extraordinary loss and devastation many who did not have electricity or running water yet every day they left their homes to go to relief centers to help perfect strangers so what we have seen here in Georgia and in other states is faith in action individuals who know their power to shed light in a moment of darkness we have seen the good Samaritans walking among us and for that reason I say as the scripture tells us we then must remember that and not be weary let us not be weary in moments like this let us focus on what God shows us about the good Samaritans walking among us to remind us of the power the agency the ability and dare I say the duty that we have to come to another's aid in moments of need to love thy neighbor and what God is showing us is that any of us can do that no matter who we are and I know and I learned this at a young age and I'll share with you a quick story so during my final year of law school I was a summer intern in the DA's office in Oakland California and I was working in the Superior Courthouse and there was this one case that I got and it was it involved a drug bust and the police had arrested a number of people including an innocent bystander a woman who had been in the wrong place at the wrong time and when I got the case it was a late Friday afternoon and most folks had gone home for the weekend and I knew in all likelihood the judge would probably not see her case until that following Monday which would have meant that she would have had to spend the whole weekend in jail now this woman had children she is a mother she had children at home and I wondered if they even knew that their mother had been arrested who would take care of them if she could not would child protective services come and take those children everything was on the line for that woman so I rushed to the clerk of the court and asked them to have the case called that day and then when that did not work I pleaded with them remember I was not vice president I was an intern so yes I pleaded and finally the judge returned to the bench and reviewed her case and with a pound of his gavel she was free to go home and she would go home to see her children and take care of them and I never did get the chance to meet that woman but I will never forget that moment and I share that story to say that we have all in our lives from the earliest stages of our lives had those moments where it has been revealed to us our power and we should never let anyone take our power from us or in any way try to convince us we are powerless and so I say as we move forward let us look at where we are and understand the lesson of the gospel of Luke because right now each of us has an opportunity to make a difference in this moment our country is at a crossroads and where we go from here is up to us as Americans and as people of faith and now we ask a question we face this question what kind of country do we want to live in a country of chaos fear and hate or a country of freedom compassion and justice and the great thing about living in a democracy is that we the people have the power to answer that question so let us answer not just through our words but through our action and with our votes when we come across our brothers and sisters in need let us as the good Samaritan did see in the face of a stranger a neighbor and let us recognize that when we shine the light in moments of darkness it will guide our feet into the path of peace and let us remember that while weeping may endure for a night joy coming in the morning thank you may God bless you may God bless the United States of America thank you all very much.,chunk_2,1794

I'm going to show you how to make a simple, simple, and easy to make. I'm going to show you how to make a simple, simple, and easy to make. I'm going to show you how to make a simple, simple, and easy to make. I have a 7-year-old son and a wonderful 72-year-old mother who is suffering from dementia and requires full-time care. My son is in second grade. My mother is in a nursing home and I work full-time. The costs of childcare are generally underpaid, which makes it difficult for them to support their own families and do the jobs that they need to do. How do you propose to help bridge this gap, making both child and elder care more affordable for hardworking families and also retaining and attracting quality talent for these essential jobs? So first of all, you're dealing with a lot. You're dealing with a lot. And I just wish you strength and support. You are a part of what we call the sandwich generation, which are those parents and children who are right in the middle. They are taking care of their young children and taking care of their parents as they age. And it's a lot. And so I actually plan to address this in a substantial way because I actually bring a personal experience to it as well. I took care of my mother when she was sick. And that work is the work of trying to cook something that they feel like eating, right? Trying to figure out which clothes will not irritate their skin and help them put on a sweater. And it's about trying to figure out how you can say something that brings a smile to their face or makes them laugh. It's about dignity. Meanwhile, you have a second grader. You try and teach that kid how to read. Spending time with them. Reminding them they are special and can be anything. And in the middle of all of that, if you are working or just to have a minute to breathe, it's a lot. It's a lot. So, the way that this plays out for many people is one of just a couple of ways. One, if you have the good fortune of having enough extra money, you can hire somebody to come in and then exactly as you said, you, knowing what you just shared with us about yourself, would pay them their work. Or someone in this position would have to basically spend down all their savings so they could qualify for Medicaid. Which means they pretty much have to give it everything. Or they have to quit their job. Which means one less income in their household. And this is a matter, this issue for me is a matter of dignity. Yours, your parents, and the well-being of your child. And you being able to do what you naturally want to do and the thing that we should value in our society. Which is someone like you who is taking on the duty and the responsibility of all of that. So my plan is that instead of those scenarios I've just mapped out, we will restructure it so that Medicare covers the cost of Medicare for your parent. So that they can be at home. And you can then have the assistance with someone who can help prepare that meal, help them get dressed, and you can still give that baby of yours all the love that they deserve. And you can have sanity in the process. And everyone can have dignity. And so this is my approach. Let's just look at this as an let's just come at it from common sense by the way. It's just common sense. And what makes, what is a common sense practical approach to doing this because when you are able to be productive, we all benefit by the way. When that child is able to have a parent who is able to help them with their reading and remind that child that they are special, we are all going to benefit from that. So thank you for raising the subject. Thank you. And you take care of yourself. Okay, next we're going to call on Ashley Scott speaking of Gen Z, although I guess I shouldn't assume I know what generation she's from, but she is a student from Bucks County. Hi. Hi, Vice President Harris and Congresswoman Chaney. My name is Ashley Scott. I'm from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. And I am Gen Z. I'm 22 years old. Failed it. So thank you for that compliment. But yeah, my question is about maternal health, specifically in the United States, maternal mortality is devastating, the rates are terrible. And I was wondering if you have a plan to combat the crisis. Thank you, Ashley. And thank you for being here and your voice. It's a big issue. So we have the very, I think, shameful distinction of any wealthy nation having one of, if not the highest rate of maternal mortality. And I've studied this issue I worked on when I was in the United States Senate and as Vice President. And the fact is that 90% of them are preventable. Which tells us we can do something about it. Right? And it is an issue. So black women are three to four times more than women. And we know that when that care is available, they are having a healthier and by the way, they are having a healthier care. And we know that when that care is available, they are having a healthier care. And by the way, we know that when that care is available, they are having a healthier care. And I think that's a good point. They are having a healthier and by the way, happier experience. And the long-term impact to all of us as a society, much less to that family, is immense. And so the work that we have been doing and the work I intend to do going forward is to address that. Right? So for example, in rural America, the way that the system has been structured, the healthcare system has been structured, is a lot of those hospitals and clinics have had to close. Because of the way we reimburse based on population size and as people are leaving rural America, then the hospitals and the clinics can't afford the overhead. I'm oversimplifying, but just to make the point. So we need to address that in terms of how we're structuring, how we create incentives and give the resources to those healthcare facilities, be they clinics or hospitals. The other piece that we have to do is really just talk more about the issue around also how in the healthcare system we are treating women. And are we taking women seriously? When they talk about their healthcare concerns. So again, personal experience, my mother had two goals in her life. To raise her two daughters, my sister and I, and to end breast cancer. My mother was a breast cancer researcher. And she was so passionate about women's healthcare. And I remember it as a young girl and throughout my life. And we still have a lot of work to do. To make sure that we're doing what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what we're doing, what has happened to women when women are facing situations where they can't get the care they need, where in places like Texas, for example, the Attorney General is talking about is suing to get access to women's medical records. That's not sustainable for us as a country, and it has to change. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So as we come close to time here, I want to ask you both kind of a final question. You know, I watched the conversation in the country and the way that the media covers this election, and it's often about the race. Who's up in a poll? Who's down in a poll? And I don't always feel like I'm talking about the stakes enough. And this Cheney would not be here if she didn't think the stakes were very high. And frankly, the Republicans wouldn't be so angry at you if they didn't think you were an effective surrogate as somebody speaking about the states. Some Republicans. Some Republicans. Hashtag not all Republicans. I've seen a lot of Republicans. I've seen it, and I know it happens who they encourage constantly. I know it. They're going to vote the right way on November 5th. They might not be public about it, but they'll do what they know is right. Thank you. Thank you. But just to close, and maybe starting with you, Congresswoman, so you can have the last word, talk to me and all of us about the stakes. Many people in the room here are undecided voters. What's kind of the last pitch that you would make about why this election is so important and why you believe they should vote for the vice president? Well, I think that in this election, and especially here in Pennsylvania, we have the opportunity to tell the whole world who we are. And we have the chance to say, you know, we're going to reject cruelty. We're going to reject the kind of betrayal that we've seen from Donald Trump. We're going to reject the misogyny that we've seen from Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. Um... Um... And we have the chance in this race to elect somebody who you know is going to defend the rule of law. You know Vice President Harris is going to defend our Constitution. We have the chance to remind people that we are a good country. We are good and honorable people. We are a great nation. And in this race we have the opportunity to vote for and support somebody you can count on. We're not always going to agree, but I know Vice President Harris will always do what she believes is right for this country. She has a sincere heart and that's why I'm honored to be here and supporting her in this race. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Pennsylvania with Liz Cheney & Sarah Longwell,chunk,"I have a 7-year-old son and a wonderful 72-year-old mother who is suffering from dementia and requires full-time care. My son is in second grade. My mother is in a nursing home and I work full-time. The costs of childcare are generally underpaid, which makes it difficult for them to support their own families and do the jobs that they need to do. How do you propose to help bridge this gap, making both child and elder care more affordable for hardworking families and also retaining and attracting quality talent for these essential jobs? So first of all, you're dealing with a lot. You're dealing with a lot. And I just wish you strength and support. You are a part of what we call the sandwich generation, which are those parents and children who are right in the middle. They are taking care of their young children and taking care of their parents as they age. And it's a lot. And so I actually plan to address this in a substantial way because I actually bring a personal experience to it as well. I took care of my mother when she was sick. And that work is the work of trying to cook something that they feel like eating, right? Trying to figure out which clothes will not irritate their skin and help them put on a sweater. And it's about trying to figure out how you can say something that brings a smile to their face or makes them laugh. It's about dignity. Meanwhile, you have a second grader. You try and teach that kid how to read. Spending time with them. Reminding them they are special and can be anything. And in the middle of all of that, if you are working or just to have a minute to breathe, it's a lot. It's a lot. So, the way that this plays out for many people is one of just a couple of ways. One, if you have the good fortune of having enough extra money, you can hire somebody to come in and then exactly as you said, you, knowing what you just shared with us about yourself, would pay them their work. Or someone in this position would have to basically spend down all their savings so they could qualify for Medicaid.",chunk_9,386
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Pennsylvania with Liz Cheney & Sarah Longwell,chunk,"Which means they pretty much have to give it everything. Or they have to quit their job. Which means one less income in their household. And this is a matter, this issue for me is a matter of dignity. Yours, your parents, and the well-being of your child. And you being able to do what you naturally want to do and the thing that we should value in our society. Which is someone like you who is taking on the duty and the responsibility of all of that. So my plan is that instead of those scenarios I've just mapped out, we will restructure it so that Medicare covers the cost of Medicare for your parent. So that they can be at home. And you can then have the assistance with someone who can help prepare that meal, help them get dressed, and you can still give that baby of yours all the love that they deserve. And you can have sanity in the process. And everyone can have dignity. And so this is my approach. Let's just look at this as an let's just come at it from common sense by the way. It's just common sense. And what makes, what is a common sense practical approach to doing this because when you are able to be productive, we all benefit by the way. When that child is able to have a parent who is able to help them with their reading and remind that child that they are special, we are all going to benefit from that. So thank you for raising the subject. Thank you. And you take care of yourself. Okay, next we're going to call on Ashley Scott speaking of Gen Z, although I guess I shouldn't assume I know what generation she's from, but she is a student from Bucks County. Hi. Hi, Vice President Harris and Congresswoman Chaney. My name is Ashley Scott. I'm from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. And I am Gen Z. I'm 22 years old. Failed it. So thank you for that compliment. But yeah, my question is about maternal health, specifically in the United States, maternal mortality is devastating, the rates are terrible. And I was wondering if you have a plan to combat the crisis. Thank you, Ashley. And thank you for being here and your voice.",chunk_10,388
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Pennsylvania with Liz Cheney & Sarah Longwell,chunk,"It's a big issue. So we have the very, I think, shameful distinction of any wealthy nation having one of, if not the highest rate of maternal mortality. And I've studied this issue I worked on when I was in the United States Senate and as Vice President. And the fact is that 90% of them are preventable. Which tells us we can do something about it. Right? And it is an issue. So black women are three to four times more than women. And we know that when that care is available, they are having a healthier and by the way, they are having a healthier care. And we know that when that care is available, they are having a healthier care. And by the way, we know that when that care is available, they are having a healthier care. And I think that's a good point. They are having a healthier and by the way, happier experience. And the long-term impact to all of us as a society, much less to that family, is immense. And so the work that we have been doing and the work I intend to do going forward is to address that. Right? So for example, in rural America, the way that the system has been structured, the healthcare system has been structured, is a lot of those hospitals and clinics have had to close. Because of the way we reimburse based on population size and as people are leaving rural America, then the hospitals and the clinics can't afford the overhead. I'm oversimplifying, but just to make the point. So we need to address that in terms of how we're structuring, how we create incentives and give the resources to those healthcare facilities, be they clinics or hospitals. The other piece that we have to do is really just talk more about the issue around also how in the healthcare system we are treating women. And are we taking women seriously? When they talk about their healthcare concerns. So again, personal experience, my mother had two goals in her life. To raise her two daughters, my sister and I, and to end breast cancer. My mother was a breast cancer researcher. And she was so passionate about women's healthcare.",chunk_11,377

That's not sustainable for us as a country, and it has to change. Thank you.",chunk_12,671
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Pennsylvania with Liz Cheney & Sarah Longwell,chunk,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So as we come close to time here, I want to ask you both kind of a final question. You know, I watched the conversation in the country and the way that the media covers this election, and it's often about the race. Who's up in a poll? Who's down in a poll? And I don't always feel like I'm talking about the stakes enough. And this Cheney would not be here if she didn't think the stakes were very high. And frankly, the Republicans wouldn't be so angry at you if they didn't think you were an effective surrogate as somebody speaking about the states. Some Republicans. Some Republicans. Hashtag not all Republicans. I've seen a lot of Republicans. I've seen it, and I know it happens who they encourage constantly. I know it. They're going to vote the right way on November 5th. They might not be public about it, but they'll do what they know is right. Thank you. Thank you. But just to close, and maybe starting with you, Congresswoman, so you can have the last word, talk to me and all of us about the stakes. Many people in the room here are undecided voters. What's kind of the last pitch that you would make about why this election is so important and why you believe they should vote for the vice president? Well, I think that in this election, and especially here in Pennsylvania, we have the opportunity to tell the whole world who we are. And we have the chance to say, you know, we're going to reject cruelty. We're going to reject the kind of betrayal that we've seen from Donald Trump. We're going to reject the misogyny that we've seen from Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. Um.. Um.. And we have the chance in this race to elect somebody who you know is going to defend the rule of law. You know Vice President Harris is going to defend our Constitution. We have the chance to remind people that we are a good country. We are good and honorable people. We are a great nation. And in this race we have the opportunity to vote for and support somebody you can count on. We're not always going to agree, but I know Vice President Harris will always do what she believes is right for this country.",chunk_13,403

2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,full,"So thank you for that beautiful welcome. I wanted to introduce myself. I'm Maria Shriver, and as you heard, I'm a mom. I'm a mama G. I'm a business woman, and I'm a journalist. Yeah. I was raised in a very prominent democratic family. I married a Republican. I served as a Democratic First Lady in a Republican administration in California, so I get this bipartisan thing. I've seen it up close. And now I'm a proud independent. But perhaps best of all for all of you, what I'm really proud of is to be the mother of a graduate of the University of Michigan. Go Blue! So I have, go Blue, that's right. Okay, that's okay, healthy competition. So I've spent a lot of time in this state, and I must say I love Michigan. I love its history. I love the landscape here. How beautiful are those trees when we were driving in? Oh my God. And most of all, I love the people. I really love the people, and I was so glad to be able to meet several of you, quite a few of you before everybody took their seat. So I want you to know I'm really happy to be here. In fact, there isn't any other place I'd like to be at this moment than right here with all of you having this conversation. So thank you. Now I know you're in a swing state, so you've had it up to here. You've been, yeah, you've been inundated with ads, with texts, with phone calls, with people knocking on your door, and you are exhausted. But I'm really grateful to you for not being that exhausted, for taking the time to stand in that line, to come in here, and I'm hoping that you'll come in here with a really open mind and an open heart, and be really present for the next 45 minutes. Because what you're gonna see on this stage is historic. As I said, I grew up in a political family, and people of both parties used to get along really well. They used to work for the common good. They used to compromise, and that was an example that they set, and now you're getting to see it in real life because we haven't seen it in decades. And so that's why I'm here. I'm here to witness this, to facilitate this conversation. I'm here as a journalist, but I'm really here as a concerned citizen, and I'm really happy to be here. And so I know all of you are looking forward to hearing from both of these extraordinary women. They're both incredible, and so I wanna begin by getting going. We have some questions from the audience that we will get to. I have a few questions. As I said, I went around to meet several of you, and I heard some questions that some of you had, but universally, many of you said the reason I'm here is to see bipartisanship. I wanna see what it looks like so I can go home with information. So you're gonna get that, okay? So let's get going. So sit back, be comfortable. You're not, unfortunately. We have some pre-determined questions, and I hopefully I'll be able to ask some of the questions that might be in your head. I hope so. But so let's first, I'm gonna introduce the congresswoman from Wyoming. Liz Cheney, as you all know, is an incredible, courageous public servant. I'm a big admirer of hers. She has been going across this country, brainstorming with Kamala Harris, and she has put herself on the line. She has taken a lot of incoming for her position and for standing up in the way she has. So give her a great Michigan welcome. Representative Liz Cheney. That's right, stand up. Whoo! And she's the mother of five, okay? We were talking about that backstage. And now the MVP is going to be the president of the state of Wyoming. And she's the mother of five. And she's the mother of five. And she's the mother of five. And now the MVP that stands for Madam Vice President MVP. I wanna say several of you, and I've heard over the last several months that a lot of people say, well, I just don't know Kamala Harris that well. Well, I do. So I worked alongside her when I was First Lady of California. She was the district attorney in San Francisco. She was the attorney general of the state of California. I've seen her work up close. I've seen how she is as a person. And that's why I am here. She is really an incredible leader. She brings people together. I've seen that firsthand. And most recently, we have worked on transforming the way the federal government funds and prioritizes women's health research. For the first time, for the first time under her leadership, we are prioritizing the way women will get facts about their health and research. So if you have endometriosis, yes. Probably that means something to every woman in this audience because too many women in this country go to the doctor and they don't have any information about maternal health, about endometriosis, osteoporosis, perimenopause, menopause, Alzheimer's, MS, you name it. And she has worked diligently to try to change that trajectory and she will continue to do so. So that's a big issue that I don't think gets enough attention in this campaign. She cares about people, people, families, or at the center of her agenda. That's why she's the MVP. So please welcome Madam Vice President Kamala Harris. MUSIC Okay, here we go. Sit back. We got 40 minutes and we're gonna move quick, okay? So I want this to be like a kitchen table. Like just think that we're sitting around the kitchen table and we're jamming about all kinds of stuff. That's the feeling I want to have at this. This is like a Kennedy family kitchen table. Most people don't have this many. That's right. It's raucous, it's hot, but it's fun. That's what it's gonna be like. So this, as I was saying before, both of you walked out, this is historic. So I hope everybody takes this in for a minute to have a leader of the Republican Party and the Vice President of the United States. So let me begin with you, Madam Vice President. Did you ever think in your wildest dreams that you would be running for president alongside Liz Cheney, who'd be advocating for you, campaigning for you, a member of a opposing party, putting herself on the line for you? So let me just start by thanking everyone. Thank you all for taking time out of your busy lives to be here and have this conversation. And I think we are all here together because we have many things in common. First and foremost, we love our country. We love our country. You know, so Maria, perhaps not, but perhaps, perhaps not. But let me say this, so you mentioned, you know my background. So I started my career as a prosecutor and most of my career has been spent outside of Washington, D.C., not in Washington, D.C. And for most of my career, let me just tell you, I never once asked a victim of crime, a witness, are you a Democrat or are you a Republican? Never, it never would have even occurred to me to ask that. What I did ask everyone, are you okay? And when I think then about what is at stake in this election, I think that's the biggest question. And it is a moment we're born out of our love of our country, born out of, for me, having taken the oath of office to the Constitution States at least six times, I believe what is at stake in this election is so fundamental for us as Americans. And it is about, do we take seriously the importance of a president who obeys the oath to be loyal to the Constitution of the United States? Do we prioritize a president in the United States who cares about rule of law, much less the spirit with which they approach this most powerful position? There's so much about this last era, when I talk about turn the page, that's what I'm referring to, like the last decade, that has been about some powerful forces suggesting that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. Instead of what I think most of us believe, regardless of your party affiliation, that the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. And... And so, for that reason, I'm not surprised that Liz Cheney and I are on the same stage 15 days before the election. Okay, well, maybe you're not surprised, but I'm surprised. And I think a lot of people are surprised. So I wanna know, are you surprised? Are you surprised that you're out here campaigning for a Democrat, campaigning for Kamala Harris against the party that you've been a part of your entire life? You know, what I would say, first of all, is, we all know, everyone who watched January 6th knows, you know, what Donald Trump is willing to do. He lost the election, he tried to overturn it and seize power, and then he sat in his dining room and he watched the attack on television. He watched it. People pleaded with him to tell the mob to leave and he wouldn't. And he watched law enforcement officers be brutally beaten. He watched it. That's a depravity that, to me, and, you know, I think to anyone who's taken the oath of office, makes someone absolutely unfit ever to be president again. Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now...

Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now, of course, we'll take care of that. We'll take care of November. Yes. We'll take care of November. But it is brutally serious, because to the Congresswoman's point, anyone who has openly said as he has, that he would terminate the Constitution of the United States, should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. So, Madam Vice President, I wanted to ask you several people that I talked to in preparation for this. When I asked them, they said, well, I want to vote for the Vice President, but I just don't feel like I know her. I don't know enough about her. I see the ads, but I don't have a feel for her. What are three things you can tell this audience about you that aren't in your ads, that people aren't telling people on the robocalls, that perhaps they just wouldn't know, that might give them a feeling for who you are as a woman? How much time do we have? We're at the kitchen table. I have lived a full life. I am a wife. I am a mother. I am a sister. I am a godmother. I love to cook. I started my career as a prosecutor. In large part, there are many reasons, but one very fundamental is when I was young, one of my best friends in high school I learned was being molested by her stepfather. And I told her when I learned she had to come live with us, talk to my mother about it. Of course she has to come live with us, and she did. And I decided I wanted to take on a career and a life that was about protecting the most vulnerable. I served as Attorney General of California, two terms. I was the top law enforcement officer of the big state in the country. And doing that work, it included prosecuting transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. I did the work of taking on the big banks during the foreclosure crisis and deliver $20 billion for homeowners who had been targeted with predatory lending practices. I took on the big pharmaceutical companies on behalf of consumers. As Vice President of the United States, my priorities have been many, including to your point the work that you and I have done over the years, focusing on women's health, one of my priorities has been maternal mortality. But I have only had one client in my career, the people. And my belief is that there is great nobility in public service if one understands that they hold the office and the public trust. It is not about personal power. It is about what you can do that lifts up the condition of people. And there is so much about how I think about my responsibility, and I am here to ask for your vote, is that I do, I intend to be a president for all Americans, understanding that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And this era that was kind of initiated by Donald Trump has not only been exhausting, it has been harmful to us as a nation. The notion that a president of the United States would encourage Americans to point fingers at each other, that there would be a suggestion that we are a divided country that instead of knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. I have, as Vice President, met over 150 world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. My most recent overseas trips as Vice President, which were relatively close to then the election, our allies have expressed real concern. I shared this before, but you know, when we walk in a room representing the United States of America, we should walk in that room, especially leaders, chin up, shoulders back, knowing that we have the self-appointed and earned authority to talk about the importance of democracy and rule of law. But the thing about being a role model, this is all role models who are here, people watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say. People around the world are watching this election, I promise you. And my one fear I have is, I hope and I pray that we, the American people, understand not only what is at stake for us in this election, but how much we mean to the rest of the world. There is so much at stake in this election. Please, Cheney, tell us real quick, I want to get to our first question, but you've been traveling with the Vice President, you've been working with her, you've been spending human time with her. Tell the audience what you see that perhaps the camera doesn't get or the ads don't get so that they can get a sense of her that you have. Well, I think that what I could tell you is that what the Vice President is saying about wanting to be a President for all Americans, caring deeply about this country, those are things that come across very clearly and very directly. And look, I'm a conservative. The very first campaign I ever volunteered in was for President Gerald Ford in 1976. And ever since then, I have been voting for Republicans. I've never voted for a Democrat. Wow. And so the fact that I believe so strongly that in this election, in this election, we need to elect the person who is the responsible adult. And we need... And there is a lot, both parties do it. There is a lot of vilification that goes on. Yeah. And I think it's really important for people to think very carefully about the power that we're going to invest in the President of the United States and what it would mean to give that power to Donald Trump. Don't take my word for who he is. Listen to him every day. Look at what he did. Remember that the people, as the Vice President said, who are opposing him are the people who know him best, the people who worked most closely with him. And so I would just say I know that the Vice President has had the range of experience as Vice President, as Senator, as Attorney General of California. She is supremely qualified to be President of the United States. I think there are sometimes there are some men who suggest that she's not. But if you look at her qualifications, there's no question. And that she's somebody that I know I can count on who will put the good of this country first. There's just no question. Okay. I want to go over here to Cecilia. Cecilia Borland, can you stand up? You have a question. Cecilia grew up in Birmingham, Michigan, which was a Republican stronghold as she grew up. She now lives with her husband. They're raising two children in Berkeley, Michigan. And she's here with a question for the Vice President. Thank you both for coming to Michigan today for this important event. I'd like to start by saying personally thank you, Representative Cheney, for, to you and your father for exemplifying putting country over party. And Madam Vice President, I hope you had a wonderful birthday yesterday. Thank you. Thank you. From the shootings at Oxford High School to my alma mater, Michigan State University, to an attack at a kid's splash pad this summer, just a few miles away from here. The issue of gun violence that hits very close to home for our community. Just yesterday I learned from our school district that my preschooler will be going through his first active shooter drill this week. Yeah. As a gun violence survivor and mother of two young children, the issue of gun violence and the safety of my children in their schools and in our community is my top priority. Madam Vice President, if you are elected president and there is a Republican majority in Congress, how will you work with them to make impactful and immediate progress around gun violence, especially in our children schools? Thank you. Thank you. And thank you for your courage to speak up about this. So, what we have done actually in the last four years, we had a bipartisan group of folks in Congress who came together for the Safer Communities Act, which is the first meaningful piece of gun safety legislation in 30 years. And so it's a good step and it really does tell us that we have a will within the United States Congress to work in a bipartisan way. And then Congresswoman Cheney was one of those Republicans that actually voted for it. This is how I think of the issue and it is through the lens of many experiences, including, I'm so sorry about your kids going to the active shooter drills. It's traumatic that our children, you know, growing up, I'll speak for myself, we had fire drills. Right? Our children are now learning how to keep themselves safe if there is an active shooter at their school. I did a tour last year of colleges with college aged kids, so I also did some trade schools. And I would ask at the room, the auditorium would be packed, college aged kids, and I'd ask them, raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade, you had to endure an active shooter drill. Almost every hand went up. Our kids are growing up where they are learning that they may be unsafe in the classroom, where they should be absorbing the wonders of the world. One kid said to me, yeah, we were talking about this and said to me, yeah, that's why I don't like going to fifth period. I said, why sweetheart, why don't you like going to fifth period? Because in that classroom there's no closet. No. In which to hide. So, when we think of this issue, we must also consider the trauma, that is, the trauma, the direct trauma for those who have been directly affected by gun violence, including that to our kids who are in schools across our country doing this, not to mention their teachers, who want to teach and not also have to worry about, will they be able to physically protect a child from a bullet? Here's how I think about it in terms of the macro point. We have been pushing as a country, I think, a false choice that suggests you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away. And that's a false choice. I'm in favor of the Second Amendment. I have talked about the fact that both Tim Walsh and I are gun owners. I also believe we need reasonable gun safety laws, assault weapons bans, red flag laws, universal background checks. And reports say that the majority of NRA members agree on, for example, universal background checks. What is a universal background check? It's just common sense. Here's what it is. You just might want to know before someone can buy a lethal weapon, whether they've been found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others. You just might want to know. It's common sense. We need common sense gun safety laws. And I will continue, I've done it throughout my career, work with all of our colleagues across the aisle. And I know that we can make progress. But this is not, I'm not trying to take anybody's guns away from them. But we need reasonable gun safety laws. Okay, I want to come back to the issue of public safety in a minute. But first we want to go to Martin. Thank you, Cecilia, very much. Martin Howellick, he's a former Republican member of the Michigan House of Representatives. And he's here with a question about national security. Thank both of you for being here this afternoon. I really appreciate you're coming to the state of Michigan to be here. I would like to ask, what can the U.S. do politically, economically, or militarily to deter Russia from continuing its war on the independent nation of Ukraine? While simultaneously strengthening our own U.S. security interests. Thank you, Martin. Go ahead. So, I was actually in Munich at the Munich Security Conference delivering a speech when I first met with President Zelensky of Ukraine. And it was just days before Russia invaded. I've now met with President Zelensky, I think, seven times. Because the United States has rightly taken a position as a leader, a global leader, on international rules and norms. That we must stand in support of one of the most important international rules and norms. Which is the importance of protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. The importance of standing strong in opposition to the notion that in this case, Russia would attempt to change borders by force. To invade another nation, a sovereign nation by force. And sadly, there is a huge difference between my opponent and me on this very fundamental issue. Back to the conversation about, there was a time when we used to, there was a phrase, that I'll paraphrase, basically politics ends at the sea line, at the boundaries of our country. That there are certain things, in particular the matters of national security. Where it's not about partisanship, it's about where should America stand. In terms of supporting our allies and standing for certain principles. I'll give you as a point of reference for me, in terms of how I feel about this on the partisan issue. For the four years that I was in the United States Senate, my favorite committee was the Senate Intelligence Committee. And I served on that committee and we would meet in a room that's called a skiff. It's basically a, it's a very secure room. No press, with all due respect, are allowed in, no cameras. Everyone has to leave their cell phone outside. It's a bipartisan committee. And we would go in that room and receive classified information from America's intelligence community, sometimes our military leaders, about hotspots around the world and threats to our national security. And when we went in that room, and this is why it was my favorite committee, people would take off their suit jacket, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table. And we weren't Democrats or Republicans, we were Americans. And that is so important on a number of issues we are discussing this afternoon, but in particular on national security. My opponent, however, has made it a thing of his to admire dictators and autocrats around the world. He exchanged love letters with Kim Jong-un, remember that? He has openly praised the president of Russia. Most recently the report is, in the height of COVID, remember everyone was scrambling to get their hands on COVID tests? Remember when Americans were dying by the hundreds every day and Donald Trump secretly sent COVID tests to the president of Russia for his personal use? He has said, Donald Trump, I will solve the matter of Ukraine and Russia in a day. You read through and understand what he is saying. He would surrender. He would have Ukraine surrender its fight against an aggressor, violating its sovereignty. If Donald Trump were president, Vladimir Putin will be sitting in Kiev and understand what that would mean for America and our standing around the world. But thankfully there has been bipartisan support and to your point of where you stand on this very fundamental issue, but this is a very vivid example of what is at stake in this election, because Donald Trump has been very clear. He would give away the shop. He has been manipulated and is so clearly able to be manipulated by favor and flattery, including from dictators and autocrats around the world. And America knows that that is not how we stand, that is not how we fight. We fight in favor of our strength and our role as a leader in bringing the allies together and standing for foundational and fundamental principles. Congressman Cheney. I know kind of the issue of national security is one of the big reasons you are here and supporting the vice president. Can you expand on that answer and add your thoughts to it? Yeah, you know, I think that if you look at where the Republican Party is today, there has been a really dangerous embrace of isolationism, a dangerous embrace of tyrants. The president, you know, even just today, he heaps praise on the world's most evil people while he attacks, you know, with venom his political opponents here at home. And, you know, the reality is that since the end of World War II, America has led. And we've led, and that has been necessary to defend our freedom. And we can't do it by ourselves, though. We need our allies. And when Donald Trump says that he's going to withdraw from NATO, when he invites Vladimir Putin to invade NATO, when he suggests that it is Zelensky's fault that Ukraine was invaded. I mean, that is, that is, for anybody who is a Republican who is thinking that, you know, they might vote for Donald Trump because of national security policy, I ask you please, please study his national security policy. Not only is it not Republican, it's dangerous. And without allies, America will find our very freedom and security challenged and threatened. And one final point on this, don't think that Congress can stop him. People say, well, you know what, he can't really do the worst, you know, because Congress will step in. All he has to do is what he's doing is say, I won't fulfill our NATO treaty obligations. And NATO begins to unravel. So it is an incredibly dangerous thing to think about a foreign policy, a national security policy led by somebody who is as unstable as Donald Trump is. And it's a risk we just simply can't take as a nation. And I'm going to add a triumphant emphasis that let's also be clear about on the subject specifically of Ukraine. Donald Trump's approach would be to surrender. Understand what that would mean. That is signaling to the president of Russia he can get away with what he has done. Understand, look at the map. Poland would be next. NATO, our allies are the reason that they have been so thankful for the position of strength we have taken in bringing the allies together is because they are fully aware of and remember the Congresswoman's point. World War II, remember this concept of isolation. We were once there as a nation. And then Pearl Harbor happened. Let's remember recent history. Europe remembers it well. We then when we got attacked Pearl Harbor, we jumped in. And it is because America jumped in that we were ultimately able to win that war. And it should be a constant reminder to us. We have to remember history that isolationism, which is exactly what Donald Trump is pushing, pull out a NATO, abandon our friends. Isolationism is not insulation. It is not insulation. It will not insulate us from harm in terms of our national security. So I say that to emphasize a point that the Congresswoman made and the other point I'd make is also check out where he's been on how he thinks about America's military and service members. One of the great, great American heroes of prisoner of war, John McCain. Remember how he talked about John McCain? He said he didn't like him because he got caught. You look, he's called members of our military suckers and losers. And then look at how some of the highest ranking members of our military, including what I mentioned earlier, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a dedicated member, leader in America's military, how he has assessed Donald Trump, fascism to his core. So there you're talking points for the kitchen table. Our final question is from Courtney. Courtney, can you stand? Courtney is Courtney Cabera Agruza is a wife, a mom, an attorney, and she's a proud Kaldian. And she is here with a question. Courtney. Thank you so much. Good evening. Good evening, Madam Vice President Harris and Representative Cheney. My name is Courtney Cabara Agruza and I am a first generation Kaldian American. Kaldians are indigenous Iraqis who are Catholic and we are predominantly in the Metro Detroit area. Kaldians are a very close knit community, but the recent political climate has really begun to divide us. While I know that you have discussed several bipartisan proposals over the course of your campaign. What would you say to people like myself, who are part of these traditionally conservative communities who want to move forward but are feeling the professors, the pressures of the political divide. Thank you. And I've actually met with members and leaders in the Kaldian community and thank you for being here. You know, I think that there is something at stake that is about core values as well as what is at stake in terms of the risk and the danger. And I would offer you an example of what I think would be an important issue that would affect the Kaldian community and all Americans. For example, the issue of how we think about health care in America. So I know enough about the culture and to know that it is reflective of who we are as Americans in general. We respect our elders. We take care of them. So I will share with you a specific proposal that is an extension of how I think about things. I actually, personal story, I took care of my mother when she was sick. And for anyone taking care of or who has taken care of an elder relative, you know what that is. It's about trying to cook something they feel like eating. It is trying to find clothes that don't irritate their skin or help them put on a sweater. It's about trying to figure out something you can say that will bring a smile to their face or make them laugh. It's about dignity. And we now have in particular in our country a lot of people doing that and also raising young kids. We call them the sandwich generation right in the middle. It's a lot. And the way the system currently works, well, God willing you may have enough resources, you can hire somebody to come in and help. If not, you may have to spend down all of your savings to be able to qualify for Medicaid. Or you may have to quit your job to be able to do what you need to do to take care of your children and take care of your older relative. That's just not right and it's not fair. So part of my proposal and the plan is that we're going to now reconfigure so that Medicare covers home health care for our seniors. Right? It's about dignity. So in addition to everything that we've discussed already about national security, what is at stake? Something like this because I absolutely do believe America is ready for a new generation of leadership. That is taking on issues clear-eyed about what is going on that affects everybody, doesn't matter their political party. Issues that are fundamentally about dignity, also about economic issues. And taking it on in a way that we relieve the American people of the burdens that get in the way of productivity and a certain quality of life. And this is one example of that. I believe we need to have an economy that I call an opportunity economy where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, not just get by but get ahead. And this is one example I would offer under the broader point, which is about let's move forward, taking on problems from a common sense approach. That is about just practical work. Look, I am a capitalist. I am a pragmatic capitalist. I will work as I have with the private sector. I believe we have to invest in America's economy and America's industry and America's entrepreneurs. And we can at the same time take care of those that are the most in need of just a little support to be able to not just get by but get ahead. Thank you, Courtney. Liz, I just want to, we have two minutes left. And when you hear the phrase a new way forward, when you hear country over party, what does that mean to you? We're two weeks out. What does a new way forward mean for families like everybody here for your children, my children, everybody's children, young men? Yeah. What is it like? I think that, you know, we're at a moment now where when you think about America and the beacon of hope that we have been for so many years, for so many communities, also how tremendously enriched we have been by communities, immigrants who want to come here and build a life. All of that depends upon fundamentally defending the rule of law, fundamentally defending our constitution. That's what makes all of our opportunity and our freedom possible. And at the same time that we're that beacon for the world, you know, it's also because we're a good nation. Yeah. And because, you know, when you when you look at who our leader is going to be, what what Donald Trump represents is, is in many ways just cruel and not not the kind of dignity and and the kind of person that that we all want to be able to look up to. But but what I would say is that if people are uncertain, if people are thinking well, you know, I'm a conservative, I don't know that I can support Vice President Harris, I would say, I don't know if anybody's more conservative than I am. And, and, and I understand the most conservative value there is is to defend the Constitution. And if we don't come together to do that, then. And so just to finish that, I would say, to me, a new way forward is this. It's what you're seeing up here. It's having a president who will listen having a president who will say, I'm not necessarily sure I agree with you on this issue or that issue, but let's talk about it. Why do you want, you know, that policy? Why do you believe that? Someone who is willing to honor and respect all perspectives and points of views. And there's only one candidate in this race who does that. And that's Vice President Harris. In fact, a lot of polling of undecided voters who call themselves the exhausted majority said, I just want leaders who listen to one another. I just want leaders who speak respectfully to one another. I want to see decency. I want to see people I can look up to. And unfortunately, that's considered a new way forward as the representative. Let's do that. Let's do that. Yeah, let's do that. Let's make that a way forward. The final word, Madam Vice President, you know, everybody I talked to says, you know, I have to turn off the news. I can't read anything. I'm meditating. I'm doing yoga. I'm doing. I'm so anxious. I don't even know I'm eating gummies, all kinds of things, you know. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm not eating gummies. Okay, we got back there. But how do you, I mean, how do you handle this, the anxiety, the stress, the turmoil? Everybody's freaked out. I talked to the gentleman up there. He's like, I'm so scared. A woman's like, I'm so anxious. I can't sleep. Do you sleep? You know, I wake up in the middle of the night usually these days, so to be honest with you, but I work out every morning. I think that's really important to just kind of, you know, mind, body and spirit. But let me just say this. Say more about that. Say more. But I will. I work out. I try to eat well. You know, I love my family and I make sure that I talk to the kids and my husband every day. We've been, Doug and I have been kind of, you know, traveling. We're trying to cover a lot of ground, so we're not with each other every day these days, but my family grounds me in every way. But let me, if I can just speak to the, what people are feeling. We cannot despair. We cannot despair. You know, the nature of a democracy is such that I think there's a duality. On the one hand, there's an incredible strength when our democracy is intact. An incredible strength in what it does to protect the freedoms and rights of its people. Oh, there's great strength in that. And it is very fragile. It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And so that's the moment we're in. And I say do not despair because in a democracy, as long as we can keep it in our democracy, the people, every individual has the power to make a decision about what this will be. And that's, and so let's not feel powerless. Let's not let the, some, and I get it, overwhelming nature of this all, make us feel powerless because then we have been defeated. And that's not our character as the American people. We are not one to be defeated. We rise to a moment and we stand on broad shoulders of people who have fought this fight before for our country. And in many ways, let us look at the challenge then that we are being presented and not be overwhelmed by it. The baton is now in our hands to fight for, not against, but for this country we love. That's what we have the power to do. So let's own that, dare I say, be joyful in what we will do in the process of owning that, which is knowing that we can and will build community and coalitions and remind people that we're all in this together. Let's not let the overwhelming nature of this strip us of our strength. That's how I feel about this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"So thank you for that beautiful welcome. I wanted to introduce myself. I'm Maria Shriver, and as you heard, I'm a mom. I'm a mama G. I'm a business woman, and I'm a journalist. Yeah. I was raised in a very prominent democratic family. I married a Republican. I served as a Democratic First Lady in a Republican administration in California, so I get this bipartisan thing. I've seen it up close. And now I'm a proud independent. But perhaps best of all for all of you, what I'm really proud of is to be the mother of a graduate of the University of Michigan. Go Blue! So I have, go Blue, that's right. Okay, that's okay, healthy competition. So I've spent a lot of time in this state, and I must say I love Michigan. I love its history. I love the landscape here. How beautiful are those trees when we were driving in? Oh my God. And most of all, I love the people. I really love the people, and I was so glad to be able to meet several of you, quite a few of you before everybody took their seat. So I want you to know I'm really happy to be here. In fact, there isn't any other place I'd like to be at this moment than right here with all of you having this conversation. So thank you. Now I know you're in a swing state, so you've had it up to here. You've been, yeah, you've been inundated with ads, with texts, with phone calls, with people knocking on your door, and you are exhausted. But I'm really grateful to you for not being that exhausted, for taking the time to stand in that line, to come in here, and I'm hoping that you'll come in here with a really open mind and an open heart, and be really present for the next 45 minutes. Because what you're gonna see on this stage is historic. As I said, I grew up in a political family, and people of both parties used to get along really well. They used to work for the common good. They used to compromise, and that was an example that they set, and now you're getting to see it in real life because we haven't seen it in decades. And so that's why I'm here. I'm here to witness this, to facilitate this conversation.",chunk_1,404
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"I'm here as a journalist, but I'm really here as a concerned citizen, and I'm really happy to be here. And so I know all of you are looking forward to hearing from both of these extraordinary women. They're both incredible, and so I wanna begin by getting going. We have some questions from the audience that we will get to. I have a few questions. As I said, I went around to meet several of you, and I heard some questions that some of you had, but universally, many of you said the reason I'm here is to see bipartisanship. I wanna see what it looks like so I can go home with information. So you're gonna get that, okay? So let's get going. So sit back, be comfortable. You're not, unfortunately. We have some pre-determined questions, and I hopefully I'll be able to ask some of the questions that might be in your head. I hope so. But so let's first, I'm gonna introduce the congresswoman from Wyoming. Liz Cheney, as you all know, is an incredible, courageous public servant. I'm a big admirer of hers. She has been going across this country, brainstorming with Kamala Harris, and she has put herself on the line. She has taken a lot of incoming for her position and for standing up in the way she has. So give her a great Michigan welcome. Representative Liz Cheney. That's right, stand up. Whoo! And she's the mother of five, okay? We were talking about that backstage. And now the MVP is going to be the president of the state of Wyoming. And she's the mother of five. And she's the mother of five. And she's the mother of five. And now the MVP that stands for Madam Vice President MVP. I wanna say several of you, and I've heard over the last several months that a lot of people say, well, I just don't know Kamala Harris that well. Well, I do. So I worked alongside her when I was First Lady of California. She was the district attorney in San Francisco. She was the attorney general of the state of California. I've seen her work up close. I've seen how she is as a person. And that's why I am here. She is really an incredible leader. She brings people together.",chunk_2,390
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"I've seen that firsthand. And most recently, we have worked on transforming the way the federal government funds and prioritizes women's health research. For the first time, for the first time under her leadership, we are prioritizing the way women will get facts about their health and research. So if you have endometriosis, yes. Probably that means something to every woman in this audience because too many women in this country go to the doctor and they don't have any information about maternal health, about endometriosis, osteoporosis, perimenopause, menopause, Alzheimer's, MS, you name it. And she has worked diligently to try to change that trajectory and she will continue to do so. So that's a big issue that I don't think gets enough attention in this campaign. She cares about people, people, families, or at the center of her agenda. That's why she's the MVP. So please welcome Madam Vice President Kamala Harris. MUSIC Okay, here we go. Sit back. We got 40 minutes and we're gonna move quick, okay? So I want this to be like a kitchen table. Like just think that we're sitting around the kitchen table and we're jamming about all kinds of stuff. That's the feeling I want to have at this. This is like a Kennedy family kitchen table. Most people don't have this many. That's right. It's raucous, it's hot, but it's fun. That's what it's gonna be like. So this, as I was saying before, both of you walked out, this is historic. So I hope everybody takes this in for a minute to have a leader of the Republican Party and the Vice President of the United States. So let me begin with you, Madam Vice President. Did you ever think in your wildest dreams that you would be running for president alongside Liz Cheney, who'd be advocating for you, campaigning for you, a member of a opposing party, putting herself on the line for you? So let me just start by thanking everyone. Thank you all for taking time out of your busy lives to be here and have this conversation. And I think we are all here together because we have many things in common.",chunk_3,366
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"First and foremost, we love our country. We love our country. You know, so Maria, perhaps not, but perhaps, perhaps not. But let me say this, so you mentioned, you know my background. So I started my career as a prosecutor and most of my career has been spent outside of Washington, D.C., not in Washington, D.C. And for most of my career, let me just tell you, I never once asked a victim of crime, a witness, are you a Democrat or are you a Republican? Never, it never would have even occurred to me to ask that. What I did ask everyone, are you okay? And when I think then about what is at stake in this election, I think that's the biggest question. And it is a moment we're born out of our love of our country, born out of, for me, having taken the oath of office to the Constitution States at least six times, I believe what is at stake in this election is so fundamental for us as Americans. And it is about, do we take seriously the importance of a president who obeys the oath to be loyal to the Constitution of the United States? Do we prioritize a president in the United States who cares about rule of law, much less the spirit with which they approach this most powerful position? There's so much about this last era, when I talk about turn the page, that's what I'm referring to, like the last decade, that has been about some powerful forces suggesting that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. Instead of what I think most of us believe, regardless of your party affiliation, that the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. And.. And so, for that reason, I'm not surprised that Liz Cheney and I are on the same stage 15 days before the election. Okay, well, maybe you're not surprised, but I'm surprised. And I think a lot of people are surprised. So I wanna know, are you surprised? Are you surprised that you're out here campaigning for a Democrat, campaigning for Kamala Harris against the party that you've been a part of your entire life? You know, what I would say, first of all, is, we all know, everyone who watched January 6th knows, you know, what Donald Trump is willing to do.",chunk_4,411
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"He lost the election, he tried to overturn it and seize power, and then he sat in his dining room and he watched the attack on television. He watched it. People pleaded with him to tell the mob to leave and he wouldn't. And he watched law enforcement officers be brutally beaten. He watched it. That's a depravity that, to me, and, you know, I think to anyone who's taken the oath of office, makes someone absolutely unfit ever to be president again. Now.. Now.. Now.. Now.. Now.. Now.. Now..

2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"Now, of course, we'll take care of that. We'll take care of November. Yes. We'll take care of November. But it is brutally serious, because to the Congresswoman's point, anyone who has openly said as he has, that he would terminate the Constitution of the United States, should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. So, Madam Vice President, I wanted to ask you several people that I talked to in preparation for this. When I asked them, they said, well, I want to vote for the Vice President, but I just don't feel like I know her. I don't know enough about her. I see the ads, but I don't have a feel for her. What are three things you can tell this audience about you that aren't in your ads, that people aren't telling people on the robocalls, that perhaps they just wouldn't know, that might give them a feeling for who you are as a woman? How much time do we have? We're at the kitchen table. I have lived a full life. I am a wife. I am a mother. I am a sister. I am a godmother. I love to cook. I started my career as a prosecutor. In large part, there are many reasons, but one very fundamental is when I was young, one of my best friends in high school I learned was being molested by her stepfather. And I told her when I learned she had to come live with us, talk to my mother about it. Of course she has to come live with us, and she did. And I decided I wanted to take on a career and a life that was about protecting the most vulnerable. I served as Attorney General of California, two terms. I was the top law enforcement officer of the big state in the country. And doing that work, it included prosecuting transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. I did the work of taking on the big banks during the foreclosure crisis and deliver $20 billion for homeowners who had been targeted with predatory lending practices. I took on the big pharmaceutical companies on behalf of consumers. As Vice President of the United States, my priorities have been many, including to your point the work that you and I have done over the years, focusing on women's health, one of my priorities has been maternal mortality.",chunk_6,415
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"But I have only had one client in my career, the people. And my belief is that there is great nobility in public service if one understands that they hold the office and the public trust. It is not about personal power. It is about what you can do that lifts up the condition of people. And there is so much about how I think about my responsibility, and I am here to ask for your vote, is that I do, I intend to be a president for all Americans, understanding that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And this era that was kind of initiated by Donald Trump has not only been exhausting, it has been harmful to us as a nation. The notion that a president of the United States would encourage Americans to point fingers at each other, that there would be a suggestion that we are a divided country that instead of knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. I have, as Vice President, met over 150 world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. My most recent overseas trips as Vice President, which were relatively close to then the election, our allies have expressed real concern. I shared this before, but you know, when we walk in a room representing the United States of America, we should walk in that room, especially leaders, chin up, shoulders back, knowing that we have the self-appointed and earned authority to talk about the importance of democracy and rule of law. But the thing about being a role model, this is all role models who are here, people watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say. People around the world are watching this election, I promise you. And my one fear I have is, I hope and I pray that we, the American people, understand not only what is at stake for us in this election, but how much we mean to the rest of the world. There is so much at stake in this election. Please, Cheney, tell us real quick, I want to get to our first question, but you've been traveling with the Vice President, you've been working with her, you've been spending human time with her.",chunk_7,391
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"Tell the audience what you see that perhaps the camera doesn't get or the ads don't get so that they can get a sense of her that you have. Well, I think that what I could tell you is that what the Vice President is saying about wanting to be a President for all Americans, caring deeply about this country, those are things that come across very clearly and very directly. And look, I'm a conservative. The very first campaign I ever volunteered in was for President Gerald Ford in 1976. And ever since then, I have been voting for Republicans. I've never voted for a Democrat. Wow. And so the fact that I believe so strongly that in this election, in this election, we need to elect the person who is the responsible adult. And we need.. And there is a lot, both parties do it. There is a lot of vilification that goes on. Yeah. And I think it's really important for people to think very carefully about the power that we're going to invest in the President of the United States and what it would mean to give that power to Donald Trump. Don't take my word for who he is. Listen to him every day. Look at what he did. Remember that the people, as the Vice President said, who are opposing him are the people who know him best, the people who worked most closely with him. And so I would just say I know that the Vice President has had the range of experience as Vice President, as Senator, as Attorney General of California. She is supremely qualified to be President of the United States. I think there are sometimes there are some men who suggest that she's not. But if you look at her qualifications, there's no question. And that she's somebody that I know I can count on who will put the good of this country first. There's just no question. Okay. I want to go over here to Cecilia. Cecilia Borland, can you stand up? You have a question. Cecilia grew up in Birmingham, Michigan, which was a Republican stronghold as she grew up. She now lives with her husband. They're raising two children in Berkeley, Michigan. And she's here with a question for the Vice President.",chunk_8,386
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"Thank you both for coming to Michigan today for this important event. I'd like to start by saying personally thank you, Representative Cheney, for, to you and your father for exemplifying putting country over party. And Madam Vice President, I hope you had a wonderful birthday yesterday. Thank you. Thank you. From the shootings at Oxford High School to my alma mater, Michigan State University, to an attack at a kid's splash pad this summer, just a few miles away from here. The issue of gun violence that hits very close to home for our community. Just yesterday I learned from our school district that my preschooler will be going through his first active shooter drill this week. Yeah. As a gun violence survivor and mother of two young children, the issue of gun violence and the safety of my children in their schools and in our community is my top priority. Madam Vice President, if you are elected president and there is a Republican majority in Congress, how will you work with them to make impactful and immediate progress around gun violence, especially in our children schools? Thank you. Thank you. And thank you for your courage to speak up about this. So, what we have done actually in the last four years, we had a bipartisan group of folks in Congress who came together for the Safer Communities Act, which is the first meaningful piece of gun safety legislation in 30 years. And so it's a good step and it really does tell us that we have a will within the United States Congress to work in a bipartisan way. And then Congresswoman Cheney was one of those Republicans that actually voted for it. This is how I think of the issue and it is through the lens of many experiences, including, I'm so sorry about your kids going to the active shooter drills. It's traumatic that our children, you know, growing up, I'll speak for myself, we had fire drills. Right? Our children are now learning how to keep themselves safe if there is an active shooter at their school. I did a tour last year of colleges with college aged kids, so I also did some trade schools.",chunk_9,372
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"And I would ask at the room, the auditorium would be packed, college aged kids, and I'd ask them, raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade, you had to endure an active shooter drill. Almost every hand went up. Our kids are growing up where they are learning that they may be unsafe in the classroom, where they should be absorbing the wonders of the world. One kid said to me, yeah, we were talking about this and said to me, yeah, that's why I don't like going to fifth period. I said, why sweetheart, why don't you like going to fifth period? Because in that classroom there's no closet. No. In which to hide. So, when we think of this issue, we must also consider the trauma, that is, the trauma, the direct trauma for those who have been directly affected by gun violence, including that to our kids who are in schools across our country doing this, not to mention their teachers, who want to teach and not also have to worry about, will they be able to physically protect a child from a bullet? Here's how I think about it in terms of the macro point. We have been pushing as a country, I think, a false choice that suggests you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away. And that's a false choice. I'm in favor of the Second Amendment. I have talked about the fact that both Tim Walsh and I are gun owners. I also believe we need reasonable gun safety laws, assault weapons bans, red flag laws, universal background checks. And reports say that the majority of NRA members agree on, for example, universal background checks. What is a universal background check? It's just common sense. Here's what it is. You just might want to know before someone can buy a lethal weapon, whether they've been found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others. You just might want to know. It's common sense. We need common sense gun safety laws. And I will continue, I've done it throughout my career, work with all of our colleagues across the aisle. And I know that we can make progress.",chunk_10,380
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"But this is not, I'm not trying to take anybody's guns away from them. But we need reasonable gun safety laws. Okay, I want to come back to the issue of public safety in a minute. But first we want to go to Martin. Thank you, Cecilia, very much. Martin Howellick, he's a former Republican member of the Michigan House of Representatives. And he's here with a question about national security. Thank both of you for being here this afternoon. I really appreciate you're coming to the state of Michigan to be here. I would like to ask, what can the U.S. do politically, economically, or militarily to deter Russia from continuing its war on the independent nation of Ukraine? While simultaneously strengthening our own U.S. security interests. Thank you, Martin. Go ahead. So, I was actually in Munich at the Munich Security Conference delivering a speech when I first met with President Zelensky of Ukraine. And it was just days before Russia invaded. I've now met with President Zelensky, I think, seven times. Because the United States has rightly taken a position as a leader, a global leader, on international rules and norms. That we must stand in support of one of the most important international rules and norms. Which is the importance of protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. The importance of standing strong in opposition to the notion that in this case, Russia would attempt to change borders by force. To invade another nation, a sovereign nation by force. And sadly, there is a huge difference between my opponent and me on this very fundamental issue. Back to the conversation about, there was a time when we used to, there was a phrase, that I'll paraphrase, basically politics ends at the sea line, at the boundaries of our country. That there are certain things, in particular the matters of national security. Where it's not about partisanship, it's about where should America stand. In terms of supporting our allies and standing for certain principles. I'll give you as a point of reference for me, in terms of how I feel about this on the partisan issue.",chunk_11,357
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"For the four years that I was in the United States Senate, my favorite committee was the Senate Intelligence Committee. And I served on that committee and we would meet in a room that's called a skiff. It's basically a, it's a very secure room. No press, with all due respect, are allowed in, no cameras. Everyone has to leave their cell phone outside. It's a bipartisan committee. And we would go in that room and receive classified information from America's intelligence community, sometimes our military leaders, about hotspots around the world and threats to our national security. And when we went in that room, and this is why it was my favorite committee, people would take off their suit jacket, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table. And we weren't Democrats or Republicans, we were Americans. And that is so important on a number of issues we are discussing this afternoon, but in particular on national security. My opponent, however, has made it a thing of his to admire dictators and autocrats around the world. He exchanged love letters with Kim Jong-un, remember that? He has openly praised the president of Russia. Most recently the report is, in the height of COVID, remember everyone was scrambling to get their hands on COVID tests? Remember when Americans were dying by the hundreds every day and Donald Trump secretly sent COVID tests to the president of Russia for his personal use? He has said, Donald Trump, I will solve the matter of Ukraine and Russia in a day. You read through and understand what he is saying. He would surrender. He would have Ukraine surrender its fight against an aggressor, violating its sovereignty. If Donald Trump were president, Vladimir Putin will be sitting in Kiev and understand what that would mean for America and our standing around the world. But thankfully there has been bipartisan support and to your point of where you stand on this very fundamental issue, but this is a very vivid example of what is at stake in this election, because Donald Trump has been very clear.",chunk_12,355
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"He would give away the shop. He has been manipulated and is so clearly able to be manipulated by favor and flattery, including from dictators and autocrats around the world. And America knows that that is not how we stand, that is not how we fight. We fight in favor of our strength and our role as a leader in bringing the allies together and standing for foundational and fundamental principles. Congressman Cheney. I know kind of the issue of national security is one of the big reasons you are here and supporting the vice president. Can you expand on that answer and add your thoughts to it? Yeah, you know, I think that if you look at where the Republican Party is today, there has been a really dangerous embrace of isolationism, a dangerous embrace of tyrants. The president, you know, even just today, he heaps praise on the world's most evil people while he attacks, you know, with venom his political opponents here at home. And, you know, the reality is that since the end of World War II, America has led. And we've led, and that has been necessary to defend our freedom. And we can't do it by ourselves, though. We need our allies. And when Donald Trump says that he's going to withdraw from NATO, when he invites Vladimir Putin to invade NATO, when he suggests that it is Zelensky's fault that Ukraine was invaded. I mean, that is, that is, for anybody who is a Republican who is thinking that, you know, they might vote for Donald Trump because of national security policy, I ask you please, please study his national security policy. Not only is it not Republican, it's dangerous. And without allies, America will find our very freedom and security challenged and threatened. And one final point on this, don't think that Congress can stop him. People say, well, you know what, he can't really do the worst, you know, because Congress will step in. All he has to do is what he's doing is say, I won't fulfill our NATO treaty obligations. And NATO begins to unravel. So it is an incredibly dangerous thing to think about a foreign policy, a national security policy led by somebody who is as unstable as Donald Trump is.",chunk_13,384
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"And it's a risk we just simply can't take as a nation. And I'm going to add a triumphant emphasis that let's also be clear about on the subject specifically of Ukraine. Donald Trump's approach would be to surrender. Understand what that would mean. That is signaling to the president of Russia he can get away with what he has done. Understand, look at the map. Poland would be next. NATO, our allies are the reason that they have been so thankful for the position of strength we have taken in bringing the allies together is because they are fully aware of and remember the Congresswoman's point. World War II, remember this concept of isolation. We were once there as a nation. And then Pearl Harbor happened. Let's remember recent history. Europe remembers it well. We then when we got attacked Pearl Harbor, we jumped in. And it is because America jumped in that we were ultimately able to win that war. And it should be a constant reminder to us. We have to remember history that isolationism, which is exactly what Donald Trump is pushing, pull out a NATO, abandon our friends. Isolationism is not insulation. It is not insulation. It will not insulate us from harm in terms of our national security. So I say that to emphasize a point that the Congresswoman made and the other point I'd make is also check out where he's been on how he thinks about America's military and service members. One of the great, great American heroes of prisoner of war, John McCain. Remember how he talked about John McCain? He said he didn't like him because he got caught. You look, he's called members of our military suckers and losers. And then look at how some of the highest ranking members of our military, including what I mentioned earlier, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a dedicated member, leader in America's military, how he has assessed Donald Trump, fascism to his core. So there you're talking points for the kitchen table. Our final question is from Courtney. Courtney, can you stand? Courtney is Courtney Cabera Agruza is a wife, a mom, an attorney, and she's a proud Kaldian.",chunk_14,371
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"And she is here with a question. Courtney. Thank you so much. Good evening. Good evening, Madam Vice President Harris and Representative Cheney. My name is Courtney Cabara Agruza and I am a first generation Kaldian American. Kaldians are indigenous Iraqis who are Catholic and we are predominantly in the Metro Detroit area. Kaldians are a very close knit community, but the recent political climate has really begun to divide us. While I know that you have discussed several bipartisan proposals over the course of your campaign. What would you say to people like myself, who are part of these traditionally conservative communities who want to move forward but are feeling the professors, the pressures of the political divide. Thank you. And I've actually met with members and leaders in the Kaldian community and thank you for being here. You know, I think that there is something at stake that is about core values as well as what is at stake in terms of the risk and the danger. And I would offer you an example of what I think would be an important issue that would affect the Kaldian community and all Americans. For example, the issue of how we think about health care in America. So I know enough about the culture and to know that it is reflective of who we are as Americans in general. We respect our elders. We take care of them. So I will share with you a specific proposal that is an extension of how I think about things. I actually, personal story, I took care of my mother when she was sick. And for anyone taking care of or who has taken care of an elder relative, you know what that is. It's about trying to cook something they feel like eating. It is trying to find clothes that don't irritate their skin or help them put on a sweater. It's about trying to figure out something you can say that will bring a smile to their face or make them laugh. It's about dignity. And we now have in particular in our country a lot of people doing that and also raising young kids. We call them the sandwich generation right in the middle.",chunk_15,374
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"It's a lot. And the way the system currently works, well, God willing you may have enough resources, you can hire somebody to come in and help. If not, you may have to spend down all of your savings to be able to qualify for Medicaid. Or you may have to quit your job to be able to do what you need to do to take care of your children and take care of your older relative. That's just not right and it's not fair. So part of my proposal and the plan is that we're going to now reconfigure so that Medicare covers home health care for our seniors. Right? It's about dignity. So in addition to everything that we've discussed already about national security, what is at stake? Something like this because I absolutely do believe America is ready for a new generation of leadership. That is taking on issues clear-eyed about what is going on that affects everybody, doesn't matter their political party. Issues that are fundamentally about dignity, also about economic issues. And taking it on in a way that we relieve the American people of the burdens that get in the way of productivity and a certain quality of life. And this is one example of that. I believe we need to have an economy that I call an opportunity economy where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, not just get by but get ahead. And this is one example I would offer under the broader point, which is about let's move forward, taking on problems from a common sense approach. That is about just practical work. Look, I am a capitalist. I am a pragmatic capitalist. I will work as I have with the private sector. I believe we have to invest in America's economy and America's industry and America's entrepreneurs. And we can at the same time take care of those that are the most in need of just a little support to be able to not just get by but get ahead. Thank you, Courtney. Liz, I just want to, we have two minutes left. And when you hear the phrase a new way forward, when you hear country over party, what does that mean to you? We're two weeks out.",chunk_16,379
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"What does a new way forward mean for families like everybody here for your children, my children, everybody's children, young men? Yeah. What is it like? I think that, you know, we're at a moment now where when you think about America and the beacon of hope that we have been for so many years, for so many communities, also how tremendously enriched we have been by communities, immigrants who want to come here and build a life. All of that depends upon fundamentally defending the rule of law, fundamentally defending our constitution. That's what makes all of our opportunity and our freedom possible. And at the same time that we're that beacon for the world, you know, it's also because we're a good nation. Yeah. And because, you know, when you when you look at who our leader is going to be, what what Donald Trump represents is, is in many ways just cruel and not not the kind of dignity and and the kind of person that that we all want to be able to look up to. But but what I would say is that if people are uncertain, if people are thinking well, you know, I'm a conservative, I don't know that I can support Vice President Harris, I would say, I don't know if anybody's more conservative than I am. And, and, and I understand the most conservative value there is is to defend the Constitution. And if we don't come together to do that, then. And so just to finish that, I would say, to me, a new way forward is this. It's what you're seeing up here. It's having a president who will listen having a president who will say, I'm not necessarily sure I agree with you on this issue or that issue, but let's talk about it. Why do you want, you know, that policy? Why do you believe that? Someone who is willing to honor and respect all perspectives and points of views. And there's only one candidate in this race who does that. And that's Vice President Harris. In fact, a lot of polling of undecided voters who call themselves the exhausted majority said, I just want leaders who listen to one another. I just want leaders who speak respectfully to one another.",chunk_17,384
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"I want to see decency. I want to see people I can look up to. And unfortunately, that's considered a new way forward as the representative. Let's do that. Let's do that. Yeah, let's do that. Let's make that a way forward. The final word, Madam Vice President, you know, everybody I talked to says, you know, I have to turn off the news. I can't read anything. I'm meditating. I'm doing yoga. I'm doing. I'm so anxious. I don't even know I'm eating gummies, all kinds of things, you know. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm not eating gummies. Okay, we got back there. But how do you, I mean, how do you handle this, the anxiety, the stress, the turmoil? Everybody's freaked out. I talked to the gentleman up there. He's like, I'm so scared. A woman's like, I'm so anxious. I can't sleep. Do you sleep? You know, I wake up in the middle of the night usually these days, so to be honest with you, but I work out every morning. I think that's really important to just kind of, you know, mind, body and spirit. But let me just say this. Say more about that. Say more. But I will. I work out. I try to eat well. You know, I love my family and I make sure that I talk to the kids and my husband every day. We've been, Doug and I have been kind of, you know, traveling. We're trying to cover a lot of ground, so we're not with each other every day these days, but my family grounds me in every way. But let me, if I can just speak to the, what people are feeling. We cannot despair. We cannot despair. You know, the nature of a democracy is such that I think there's a duality. On the one hand, there's an incredible strength when our democracy is intact. An incredible strength in what it does to protect the freedoms and rights of its people. Oh, there's great strength in that. And it is very fragile. It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And so that's the moment we're in. And I say do not despair because in a democracy, as long as we can keep it in our democracy, the people, every individual has the power to make a decision about what this will be.",chunk_18,405
2024-10-21,Interview,Kamala Harris Conversation in Michigan with Liz Cheney & Maria Shriver,chunk,"And that's, and so let's not feel powerless. Let's not let the, some, and I get it, overwhelming nature of this all, make us feel powerless because then we have been defeated. And that's not our character as the American people. We are not one to be defeated. We rise to a moment and we stand on broad shoulders of people who have fought this fight before for our country. And in many ways, let us look at the challenge then that we are being presented and not be overwhelmed by it. The baton is now in our hands to fight for, not against, but for this country we love. That's what we have the power to do. So let's own that, dare I say, be joyful in what we will do in the process of owning that, which is knowing that we can and will build community and coalitions and remind people that we're all in this together. Let's not let the overwhelming nature of this strip us of our strength. That's how I feel about this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

2024-10-22,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with NBC News,full,"Thank you, Madam Vice President, for your time. I'm glad to be with you. Thank you. We were just talking about the campaign trail yesterday. Yes. And these key Rust Belt battlegrounds, as they call them, talking with undecided voters. Yes. We're reaching out that olive branch to these voters. You want to bring them on board. For them, for so many voters, we know that a huge issue for them is the economy. Right. It's the cost of living. I've been on the campaign trail. I hear that in the field again and again. You look at some of the numbers on this. And our new NBC News poll shows that more voters think that the Biden administration policies have hurt them rather than help them. And I wonder, are the last four years an obstacle to you in this race? Here's how I look at it. First of all, let me be very clear. Mine will not be a continuation of the Biden administration. I bring my own experiences, my own ideas to it. And it has informed a number of my areas of focus, most of which are, on to your point, lowering costs. I am traveling the country. I am very clear. Cost of grocery is still too high. The voters know what I know. So part of my plan includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries, including the work I will do dealing with price gouging, something I dealt with when I was attorney general, something I will deal with going forward. Cost of housing. I'm speaking with people of every background in every area of the country of every age. And the idea of the American dream was something that previous generations could count on, not as much anymore. Bringing down the cost of housing, by doing what I have done in my career that perhaps is a different approach, which is really actively working with the private sector, for example, home builders, to create incentives for them to build millions of new homes in housing units so we can bring down the cost, including what I will do to give people a $25,000 down payment assistance if they are a first time home buyer. So these are examples. The example is what I'm going to do to expand the child tax credit, because, listen, young parents in particular, they need help. They have a national desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources. $6,000 extra during the first year of their child's life can help them buy a crib or a car seat or clothes, the things that are so crucial to that phase of their child's development. So my plans and my policies are really directed at exactly your point, doing what we must do to bring down the cost of living, but also to help people not just get by but get ahead. And I'm proud to report to you that economists from Nobel laureates to Goldman Sachs have reviewed my economic plan versus Donald Trump's. And in comparison, have found that my plans will strengthen America's economy. His plans will weaken America's economy. Then why do you think that's not landing with voters? Because in the numbers, it's the opposite. Former President Trump leads you on this issue. Well, this is why I'm going out to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and in Michigan. Excuse me. I just got in late this morning, actually, but going to three states yesterday. And I'm going to continue being on the road. I have to earn the vote. And it means sharing with folks my plan, but also offering them what objective analysts have shown to be the contrast between me and Donald Trump. My plans are focused on working people, the middle class, and what we must do to strengthen hardworking people, to be able to do what they dream and aspire to be able to do. His plans are about giving tax cuts, massive tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations. His so-called plan for the economy, economists have estimated, will exasperate inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So there's a huge difference between he and I. Let me ask you about something that you said when you were running for president the last time around, back in 2019. At the time, you said that the elephant in the room was whether the country was ready for a woman and a woman of color to be president. So let me ask you as you sit here today, do you think the country is ready now for a woman and a woman of color to be president? Absolutely. Absolutely. And I am saying that in terms of every walk of life of our country, I think part of what is important in this election is really not only turning the page, but closing the page and the chapter on an era that suggests that Americans are divided. What I know from personal experience, from lived experience, and from my travels even most recently, the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And what the American people want in their president is a president for all Americans, which is the type and kind of president I pledge to be. This is my life's work. As you know, I started as a prosecutor. I never asked a victim of crime, a witness to crime, are you a Republican or Democrat? The only thing I ever asked them is, are you OK? And that's what the American people want to know, regardless of their race, regardless of their gender, their age. They want to know that they have a president who sees them and understands their needs and focuses on their needs, understanding we all deserve to have a president who is focused on solutions and not just fanning the flames of division and hate. You've been reluctant to lean into it, to talk about the historic nature of your candidacy on the campaign trail. Why is that? Well, I'm clearly a woman. I don't need to point that out to anyone. The point that most people really care about is, can you do the job? And do you have a plan to actually focus on them? I hear you on that. That is why I spend the majority of my time listening and then addressing the concerns, the challenges, the dreams, the ambitions, and the aspirations of the American people. They deserve to have a president who's focused on them. As opposed to a Donald Trump who is constantly focused on himself. I think that's part of why people are exhausted with Donald Trump and his approach, because it's all about himself and his personal grievances. And not about the American people, not about how are you going to help families? How are you going to help small businesses? How are you going to strengthen our economy? These are the things I'm focused on. I'm focused on investing in the new industries on which America should lead and be a global leader. I ask because to implement the agenda that you want to implement, you have to win first. You have to win the right. And right now there is a big gender gap in this race. Fewer men support you right now than they did President Biden. Some of your allies have suggested there's sexism at play. I wonder, do you think there is sexism at play here? Let me just tell you something. You've come to my events and you will see there are men and women at those events, whether it be small events or events with 10,000 people. So the experience that I am having is one in which it is clear that regardless of someone's gender, they want to know that their president has a plan to lower cost, that their president has a plan to secure America in the context of our position around the world. They want a president of the United States who honors our military, who understands the importance of America's leadership around international rules and norms. And that is regardless of gender. And that's how I will lead. Do you not see sexism as a factor in this race at all? I don't think of it that way. My challenge is the challenge of making sure I can talk with and listen to as many voters as possible and earn their vote. And I will never assume that anyone in our country should elect a leader based on their gender or their race. Instead, that that leader needs to earn the vote based on substance and what they will do to address challenges and to inspire people to know that their aspirations and their ambitions can and will be achieved through the opportunity to do that. Some of those voters that I spoke with at some of the events yesterday, for example, talked about they were there to support you, but also your agenda when it comes to reproductive rights and abortion access. And you have cast this as a matter of literal life and death as an urgent priority here. If you win, it is entirely possible that Congress will be controlled by Republicans. So what specific concessions would you be willing to make in order to get something done on abortion access as soon as possible? Well, first of all, look at what has happened since the Dobs decision came down. A decision that is a direct result of the fact that Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention they would undo the protections of Roe. They did as he intended. And now in 20 states, we have Trump abortion bans, which some make no exception for rape or incest, which criminalized health care providers in a state like Texas prison for life for doctors and nurses if they provide reproductive care. And where we have seen this issue on the ballot, to your point about elections, from red states to blue states, when freedom is on the ballot, the American people vote for freedom regardless of the party they are registered to vote with. We have seen that. And I know that there are members of the United States Congress who are well aware that their constituents are in favor of the very fundamental principle that a woman should be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. So is a question of pragmatism then, what concessions would be on the table? Religious exemptions, for example, is that something that you would consider? I don't think we should be making concessions when we're talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body. To Republicans like, for example, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, who would back something like this on a Democratic agenda, if in fact Republicans control Congress, would you offer them an olive branch? Or is that off the table? Is that not an option for you? I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals because we can go on with a variety of scenarios. Let's start with the fundamental fact. A basic freedom has been taken from the women of America. The freedom to make decisions about their own body. And that cannot be negotiable, which is that we need to put back in the protections of Roe v. Wade. And that is it. But what if you can't do that? What if you can't get that passed and you want to save lives in Florida and in Texas and in Georgia? What do you do at that point? I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole with you right now because right now it's a question that's out there. Because it's not a guarantee that Democrats will win control of Congress. Well, I'm doing everything I can to make sure that we do. On this issue, I think that what is clear to me is whether someone is, I was just with one of the leaders and I think opinion leaders in the Republican Party, Liz Cheney, who has, she is as she has stated publicly and has expressed her pride and feelings. She said it on stage yesterday. She is pro-life. But she also understands the pain and the tragedy that has happened since Donald Trump allowed Roe v. Wade to be overturned. So that's my point about what is non-negotiable. It has to be that we agree that it is so fundamental that we allow women the ability with their doctor with, if they choose talking with their faith leader to be able to make these decisions and not have the government tell her what to do. On the question of your beliefs, what you believe in, let me ask you this question very broadly speaking here. Sure. Do you believe that changed gender Americans should have access to gender-affirming care in this country? I believe we should follow the law. I mean, I think you're probably pointing to the fact that Donald Trump's campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars. They're trying to define you on this. Yes. I'm asking you to define yourself though. Just broadly speaking, what is your value? Do you believe they should have that access? I believe that people as the law states, even on this issue about federal law, that that is a decision that doctors will make in terms of what is medically necessary. I'm not going to put myself in the position of a doctor, but let's also understand that Donald Trump is running tens of millions of dollars in ads to talk about two cases, to distract from the fact that his policy and plan is also to take away the Affordable Care Act, which provides healthcare for tens of millions of people in our country, that his plan is to undo the $35 a month cap on insulin that impacts millions of seniors in our country, that his plan is to do away with the $2,000 cap on prescription medication, the annual cap, that his plan is to get rid of the Department of Education, which would mean getting rid of Head Start, that his plan is to give tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations and on the backs of middle class working people. So let's not get distracted by the issues that to your point from the introductory point you raised. People want to know that their president has a plan to make their life better. And that includes addressing bringing down the cost of living, it includes dealing with prescription medication costs, it includes addressing the housing crisis and affordable housing crisis in our country, it includes supporting our small businesses, investing in American industries and strengthening our economy. I will move on, but I don't know that I heard a clear answer from you on the issue of gender affirmation. It sounds like what you're saying is there should be something between trans Americans and their doctors. It feels like that's a long way from we see you and we love you, which was your message to trans Americans in May. What do you want the LGBTQ plus community to know as they're looking for a full throated backing from you for trans Americans? I believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect, period, and should not be vilified for who they are and should not be bullied for who they are. And that is a true statement for me, my entire career. And that has not changed. Part of the case that you're making to undecided voters and to these late deciding voters is not just the case for you for what you would do. It's the case against former President Trump. And on that, we are sitting here two weeks away from election night. Last election, the former president came out on election night and declared victory before all the votes were counted. What is your plan if he does that again in two weeks? Well, let me say this, we've got two weeks to go. And I'm very much grounded in the present in terms of the task at hand. And we will deal with election night and the days after as they come. And we have the resources and the expertise and the focus on that as well. So you have teams ready to go? Is that what you're saying? Are you thinking about that as a possibility? Of course. This is a person, Donald Trump, who tried to undo a free and fair election, who still denies the will of the people, who incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol and 140 law enforcement officers were attacked. Some were killed. This is a serious matter. The American people are at this point two weeks out being presented with a very, very serious decision about what will be the future of our country. And it includes whether we are a country that values a president who respects their duty to uphold the Constitution of the United States. Donald Trump had said he would terminate the Constitution of the United States. The American people are being presented with a choice here about whether we want a president who understands that America must stand strong as a leader around the globe or an individual in Donald Trump who openly admires dictators. My goodness, recent reports that he gave COVID test to the president of Russia during the height of the pandemic here when Americans couldn't get their hands on COVID tests. These are the choices before the American people right now. The choice before the American people. Is the choice to choose to turn the page on the division and the hate and to bring our country together knowing the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and that we can be optimistic about a new generation of leadership that is focused on what we have yet to achieve to uplifting the American people. If you win, it is entirely possible that the federal court cases against the former president will continue on. He is of course facing those felony charges. Would you consider if you win and he's convicted a pardon for former President Trump? I'm not going to get into those hypotheticals. I'm focused on the next 14 days. But do you believe, is there any part of you that subscribes to the argument that has been made in the past that a pardon could help bring America together, could help unify the country and move on? Let me tell you what's going to help us move on. I get elected president of the United States. One of the things you've talked about is having a Republican in your cabinet potentially. You've spent a lot of time on the campaign trail with former congresswoman Liz Cheney as you referenced. Is she somebody who would consider putting in the cabinet? Have you talked with her about this topic? I'll keep you posted. On immigration, because this is another issue that's really important to Americans here. Immigration's and customs enforcement, of course. Back in 2019, you stopped short of calling to abolish ICE as some Democrats were doing at the time, but you also said... I never called for abolishing ICE. Correct. You stopped short of that. That's right. That's right. You said we should critically reexamine it and you considered starting from scratch. Would you consider if your president's starting from scratch with ICE? Let me tell you what the customs and border patrol agents need, what the immigration system needs. It needs to be fixed. And it needs to be fixed in a number of ways that include bringing forth a bill that conservative members of Congress, along with others, pull together that we supported actively, that would put 1,500 more border agents at the border. To give those folks who are working around the clock and need support, the assistance they need to get their job done. What we would do with that bill, if it were brought forward, is be able to continue to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States, which is ravaging communities around our country. It would give us more resources to do what we need to do to prosecute transnational criminal organizations, something I have done. But what happened to that bill? Donald Trump got word of it and told his friends in Congress, kill the bill, don't bring it forward. Because Donald Trump would prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And again, in this election, there are two very different choices. One that is focused on solutions and the other that is focused on constant grievance and running on problems with no agenda for fixing them. In fact, on this issue of immigration, he has been an obstacle to fixing this problem. My proposal includes strengthening what we must do to ensure that we have an orderly and humane immigration system and that we fix what has been broken for a long time. It has transcended administrations and it needs to be fixed. You have made it clear that you believe this is a binary choice between you and Donald Trump. Those are the candidates on the ballot. Of course. There's only two choices. Yes. And I know that Joe Biden is not on the ballot. I understand that. But I think the reason he's not on the ballot is because he dropped out of this race. So I want to ask you, and it was largely because of that debate performance back in June, you defended him in the days before and in the days after as you were campaigning for another four years for President Biden. Can you say that you were honest with the American people about what you saw in those moments with President Biden as you were with him again and again repeatedly in that time? Of course. Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished, experienced and capable in every way that anyone would want if they're President. You never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him? It was a bad debate. People have bad debates. He is absolutely, but that's the reason why you're here and he's not running for the top of the ticket. Well, you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why. What do you think? I am running for President of the United States. Joe Biden is not. And my presidency will be about bringing a new generation of leadership to America that is focused on the work that we need to do to invest in the ambitions and aspirations of the American people. It's a judgment question. That's why I ask, can the American people trust you in these moments, even when it's maybe uncomfortable for Americans to level with Americans in that way? So that's why I ask, and it sounds like what you're saying is you feel like you never saw anything like that from President Biden. I have worked with Joe Biden, hours and hours and hours over these four years, whether it be in the situation room or the Oval Office. Joe Biden is the one who was able to bring NATO together during a crisis where for the first time in 70 years Europe saw and has seen war. Joe Biden has done the work that has been about being a leader on what we have done to fix so much of what has been broken in terms of the economy because of Donald Trump's mismanagement. I speak with not only sincerity, but with a real first-hand account of watching him do this work. I have no reluctance in saying that. No, of course I don't. Madam Vice President, thank you for your time. Thank you. Appreciate you being like us today. Thank you. Thanks for watching.

2024-10-22,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with NBC News,chunk,"Thank you, Madam Vice President, for your time. I'm glad to be with you. Thank you. We were just talking about the campaign trail yesterday. Yes. And these key Rust Belt battlegrounds, as they call them, talking with undecided voters. Yes. We're reaching out that olive branch to these voters. You want to bring them on board. For them, for so many voters, we know that a huge issue for them is the economy. Right. It's the cost of living. I've been on the campaign trail. I hear that in the field again and again. You look at some of the numbers on this. And our new NBC News poll shows that more voters think that the Biden administration policies have hurt them rather than help them. And I wonder, are the last four years an obstacle to you in this race? Here's how I look at it. First of all, let me be very clear. Mine will not be a continuation of the Biden administration. I bring my own experiences, my own ideas to it. And it has informed a number of my areas of focus, most of which are, on to your point, lowering costs. I am traveling the country. I am very clear. Cost of grocery is still too high. The voters know what I know. So part of my plan includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries, including the work I will do dealing with price gouging, something I dealt with when I was attorney general, something I will deal with going forward. Cost of housing. I'm speaking with people of every background in every area of the country of every age. And the idea of the American dream was something that previous generations could count on, not as much anymore. Bringing down the cost of housing, by doing what I have done in my career that perhaps is a different approach, which is really actively working with the private sector, for example, home builders, to create incentives for them to build millions of new homes in housing units so we can bring down the cost, including what I will do to give people a $25,000 down payment assistance if they are a first time home buyer. So these are examples.",chunk_1,381
2024-10-22,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with NBC News,chunk,"The example is what I'm going to do to expand the child tax credit, because, listen, young parents in particular, they need help. They have a national desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources. $6,000 extra during the first year of their child's life can help them buy a crib or a car seat or clothes, the things that are so crucial to that phase of their child's development. So my plans and my policies are really directed at exactly your point, doing what we must do to bring down the cost of living, but also to help people not just get by but get ahead. And I'm proud to report to you that economists from Nobel laureates to Goldman Sachs have reviewed my economic plan versus Donald Trump's. And in comparison, have found that my plans will strengthen America's economy. His plans will weaken America's economy. Then why do you think that's not landing with voters? Because in the numbers, it's the opposite. Former President Trump leads you on this issue. Well, this is why I'm going out to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and in Michigan. Excuse me. I just got in late this morning, actually, but going to three states yesterday. And I'm going to continue being on the road. I have to earn the vote. And it means sharing with folks my plan, but also offering them what objective analysts have shown to be the contrast between me and Donald Trump. My plans are focused on working people, the middle class, and what we must do to strengthen hardworking people, to be able to do what they dream and aspire to be able to do. His plans are about giving tax cuts, massive tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations. His so-called plan for the economy, economists have estimated, will exasperate inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So there's a huge difference between he and I. Let me ask you about something that you said when you were running for president the last time around, back in 2019. At the time, you said that the elephant in the room was whether the country was ready for a woman and a woman of color to be president.",chunk_2,376

He is of course facing those felony charges. Would you consider if you win and he's convicted a pardon for former President Trump? I'm not going to get into those hypotheticals. I'm focused on the next 14 days. But do you believe, is there any part of you that subscribes to the argument that has been made in the past that a pardon could help bring America together, could help unify the country and move on? Let me tell you what's going to help us move on. I get elected president of the United States. One of the things you've talked about is having a Republican in your cabinet potentially. You've spent a lot of time on the campaign trail with former congresswoman Liz Cheney as you referenced. Is she somebody who would consider putting in the cabinet? Have you talked with her about this topic? I'll keep you posted. On immigration, because this is another issue that's really important to Americans here. Immigration's and customs enforcement, of course. Back in 2019, you stopped short of calling to abolish ICE as some Democrats were doing at the time, but you also said.. I never called for abolishing ICE. Correct. You stopped short of that. That's right. That's right. You said we should critically reexamine it and you considered starting from scratch. Would you consider if your president's starting from scratch with ICE? Let me tell you what the customs and border patrol agents need, what the immigration system needs. It needs to be fixed. And it needs to be fixed in a number of ways that include bringing forth a bill that conservative members of Congress, along with others, pull together that we supported actively, that would put 1,500 more border agents at the border. To give those folks who are working around the clock and need support, the assistance they need to get their job done. What we would do with that bill, if it were brought forward, is be able to continue to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States, which is ravaging communities around our country.",chunk_9,371
2024-10-22,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with NBC News,chunk,"It would give us more resources to do what we need to do to prosecute transnational criminal organizations, something I have done. But what happened to that bill? Donald Trump got word of it and told his friends in Congress, kill the bill, don't bring it forward. Because Donald Trump would prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And again, in this election, there are two very different choices. One that is focused on solutions and the other that is focused on constant grievance and running on problems with no agenda for fixing them. In fact, on this issue of immigration, he has been an obstacle to fixing this problem. My proposal includes strengthening what we must do to ensure that we have an orderly and humane immigration system and that we fix what has been broken for a long time. It has transcended administrations and it needs to be fixed. You have made it clear that you believe this is a binary choice between you and Donald Trump. Those are the candidates on the ballot. Of course. There's only two choices. Yes. And I know that Joe Biden is not on the ballot. I understand that. But I think the reason he's not on the ballot is because he dropped out of this race. So I want to ask you, and it was largely because of that debate performance back in June, you defended him in the days before and in the days after as you were campaigning for another four years for President Biden. Can you say that you were honest with the American people about what you saw in those moments with President Biden as you were with him again and again repeatedly in that time? Of course. Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished, experienced and capable in every way that anyone would want if they're President. You never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him? It was a bad debate. People have bad debates. He is absolutely, but that's the reason why you're here and he's not running for the top of the ticket. Well, you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why.",chunk_10,371
2024-10-22,Interview,Harris participated in an interview with NBC News,chunk,"What do you think? I am running for President of the United States. Joe Biden is not. And my presidency will be about bringing a new generation of leadership to America that is focused on the work that we need to do to invest in the ambitions and aspirations of the American people. It's a judgment question. That's why I ask, can the American people trust you in these moments, even when it's maybe uncomfortable for Americans to level with Americans in that way? So that's why I ask, and it sounds like what you're saying is you feel like you never saw anything like that from President Biden. I have worked with Joe Biden, hours and hours and hours over these four years, whether it be in the situation room or the Oval Office. Joe Biden is the one who was able to bring NATO together during a crisis where for the first time in 70 years Europe saw and has seen war. Joe Biden has done the work that has been about being a leader on what we have done to fix so much of what has been broken in terms of the economy because of Donald Trump's mismanagement. I speak with not only sincerity, but with a real first-hand account of watching him do this work. I have no reluctance in saying that. No, of course I don't. Madam Vice President, thank you for your time. Thank you. Appreciate you being like us today. Thank you. Thanks for watching.

2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,full,"And welcome. We are live from Chester Township, Pennsylvania, Delaware County, one of the critical counties around Philadelphia that will help determine who wins the White House. Welcome to Sina's Presidential Town Hall with the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. I'm Anderson Cooper. Now in this room, we have assembled a group of 32 Pennsylvania voters who say they are still undecided or persuadable. All of them are registered to vote. Some cast votes for Joe Biden in 2020. Others for Donald Trump. Some didn't vote at all. And for some, this is their first election. Many are leaning right now to one candidate or another, but they all say they have yet to make their final choice. Now we found these voters working with a non-partisan research firm, as well as business and religious groups, universities, and other civic organizations. These voters are asking their own questions tonight selected by CNN to cover a variety of topics. You may see them holding a piece of paper when they're asking their question. It has their question on it. That is a question they have come up with. It has not been edited in any way by CNN. We also invited former President Donald Trump to participate in a town hall or debate. He declined. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Vice President Kamala Harris. Thank you. Thank you so much. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Thanks so much for being with us. We're going to get to the audience in just a second. I want to start by asking you, though, for weeks you have been calling Donald Trump unstable, unhinged. You've called him dangerous. You've quoted General Milley recently who called him a fascist. Today you quoted General Kelly who said that Trump repeatedly praised Hitler. But there are tens of millions of Americans right now who have heard all those things and they don't buy it or even if they do, they're still going to vote for Donald Trump. He's arguably more popular now than ever. You have 13 days to go. What do you say to those voters to convince them? Because some of them are in this room. Sure. And I thank you all for taking the time to be here. And you could be doing a number of other things with your time. So this really is proof that we love our country. People are engaged, Anderson, and really want to talk about the issues. And so the issue that you raise, yes, I do believe that Donald Trump is unstable, increasingly unstable, and unfit to serve. And I don't necessarily think that everyone has heard what you and I have heard repeatedly, which is the people who know Donald Trump best, the people who worked with him in the White House, in the Situation Room, in the Oval Office, all Republicans, by the way, who served in his administration, his former chief of staff, his national security advisor, former secretaries of defense, and his vice president have all called him unfit and dangerous. They have said explicitly he has contempt for the Constitution of the United States. They have said he should never again serve as president of the United States. We know that is why Mike Pence is not running with him again, why the job was empty. And then today we learned that John Kelly, a four star Marine general, who was his longest-serving chief of staff, gave an interview recently in the last two weeks of this election talking about how dangerous Donald Trump is. And I think one has to think about why would someone who served with him, who was not political, a four star Marine general, why is he telling the American people now? And frankly, I think of it as he's just putting out a 911 call to the American people, understand what could happen if Donald Trump were back in the White House. And this time we must take very seriously those folks who knew him best and who were career people are not going to be there to hold him back. At least before there were folks who we know what he would say, but they would restrain him. Imagine now Donald Trump in the Oval Office, in the Situation Room. He who has openly admired dictators said he would be a dictator on day one. The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has said he is a fascist to the core of the American people. So I think that when the American people reflect, especially those who are undecided, on who you should listen to, don't take my word for it. In fact, go online and listen to John Kelly, his voice, talking about what he thinks of Donald Trump two weeks before the election, because I think we all know to your point, Anderson, it is close, but there are undecided voters who clearly by being here have an open mind, want to talk in a way that is about grounded in issues and fact. And when they hear these facts, I think it compels a lot of people to be concerned about the future of our country with Donald Trump at the lead. You've quoted General Milley calling Donald Trump a fascist. You yourself have not used that word to describe him. Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist? Yes, I do. Yes, I do. And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted. Again, look at their careers. These are not people with the exception, I think of only Mike Pence. These were not politicians. These are career people who have served in the highest roles in national security, who have served as generals in our military, who are highly respected, talking about the person who would be commander in chief, not to mention what we know and what they've told us about how he talks about the military, servicemen and women, referring to them as suckers and losers, how he demeans people who have taken an oath to sacrifice their life for our country. And I do believe Anderson that part of this is why even just this week, I traveled this state and others with Liz Cheney, former Congress member who was a very high ranking Republican. She has endorsed me. Her father, the former vice president of the United States, Dick Cheney is voting for me. Over 400 members of, previous members of the administration from Ronald Reagan to both presidents Bush to Donald Trump even have endorsed my candidacy. And the reason why among them is a legitimate fear based on Donald Trump's words and actions that he will not obey an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. He himself has said he would terminate the Constitution of the United States and wants to earn your vote to stand again behind the seal of the president of the United States. No one standing behind the seal of the president of the United States of America should be in that position saying they want to terminate the Constitution of the United States. This is Annalise Keynes. She's from Philadelphia. She works as a fundraiser for Habitat for Humanity. She's registered with no party affiliation. She says she's a Democrat. She's leaning toward voting for you. But says she's yet to make her final decision in part because of the conflict in the Middle East. Annalise? Thank you and good evening, Madam Vice President. My question is as president, what would you do to ensure not another Palestinian dies due to bombs being funded by U.S. tax dollars? So I will say, and I think this is to your point, far too many innocent Palestinian civilians have been killed. It's unconscionable. And we are now at a place where with Sinwar's death, I do believe we have an opportunity to end this war, bring the hostages home, bring relief to the Palestinian people and work toward a two-state solution where Israel and the Palestinians in equal measure have security, where the Palestinian people have dignity, self-determination, and the safety that they so rightly deserve. What do you say to voters who are thinking about supporting a third party candidate or staying on the couch, not voting at all because of this issue? Listen, I am not going to deny the strong feelings that people have. I don't know that anyone who has seen the images who would not have strong feelings about what has happened, much less those who have relatives who have died and been killed. And I know people have talked with people. So I appreciate that. But I also do know that for many people who care about this issue, they also care about bringing down the price of groceries. They also care about our democracy and not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and as a fascist. They also care about the fact that we need practical common sense solutions from a leader who is willing to work across the aisle on behalf of the American people and not themselves. They want a president who cares about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body, understanding that we're not trying to change anyone's belief, but let's not have the government telling women what to do with their body. I want you to meet Beth Sandberg. She's a realtor, a mom of four from Balakindwood, Pennsylvania. She's a registered Democrat. Says she's undecided because of concerns about anti-Semitism. Beth. Hi. Thank you for being here. Thank you for remembering we need to bring the hostages home. Of course. The rise of anti-Semitism and violence from, the rise of anti-Semitism and violence from anti-Semitism has risen greatly on college campuses and on our city streets in the last year. How would you combat this growing trend and protect our young adults? Thank you, Beth. You are right. And I will say that we have seen a rise in anti-Semitism. It is something that we have to be honest about and we have to deal with. As Attorney General, I actually published a hate crimes report on a regular basis and anti-Semitism was among the highest forms of hate in our country. And this was before October 7. And we know what we've seen since. Part of what we've got to do is talk with people so that they understand what are the tropes, what are the roots of what we are seeing so that we can actually have people be more understanding. We need to have laws in place that make those who would commit crimes on behalf of anti-Semitism and hate that they pay a serious consequence. We need to have the deterrence so that doesn't happen. We need to ensure that college students are safe in their school and feel safe to be able to go to class. But I'm going to tell you what doesn't help. Again, I invite you to listen and go online to listen to John Kelly, the former Chief of Staff of Donald Trump, who has told us, Donald Trump said, essentially, why aren't my generals like those of Hitler's? Like Hitler, who has referred several times, we've heard the reports for years. Do you believe Donald Trump is anti-Semitic? I believe Donald Trump is a danger to the well-being and security of America. He has said that he's casting himself as a protector of Israel. Do you believe you would be more pro-Israel than Donald Trump? I believe that Donald Trump is dangerous. I believe that when you have a president of the United States who has said to his generals, who work for him because he is commander-in-chief, these conversations, I assume, many of them took place in the Oval Office. And if the president of the United States, the commander-in-chief, is saying to his generals, in essence, why can't you be more like Hitler's generals, Anderson? Come on. This is a serious, serious issue. And we know who he is. He admires dictators, sending love letters back and forth with Kim Jong-un. Talks about the president of Russia, and then most recently the reports are that in the height of COVID, when most Americans could not get their hands on a COVID test, Americans were dying by the hundreds a day, he secretly sent COVID tests to the president of Russia for his personal use. So, again, this election in 13 days is presenting the American people with a very significant decision. And on the one side, on this issue of who is going to model what it means to use the bully pulpit of the president of the United States in a manner that in tone, word, and deed, is about lifting up our discourse, fighting against hate, as opposed to fanning the flames of hate which Donald Trump does consistently. I'm going to tell you, we are an incredible country, and we love our country. Y'all wouldn't be here unless we love our country. And there are certain things where we've just got to come together and realize that we do believe in the importance of healthy debate on real issues, but there are certain standards we've got to have. And, you know, another point that even John Kelly talked about, I believe, and many have, is January 6th, where you have the president of the United States defying the will of the people in a free and fair election and unleashing a violent mob who attacked the United States Capitol, 140 law enforcement officers were attacked, some were killed. And so I say that to say, the American people deserve to have a president who encourages healthy debate, works across the aisle, not afraid of good ideas wherever they come from, but also maintains certain standards about how we think about the role and the responsibility, and certainly not comparing oneself in a clearly admiring way to Hitler. And we are back with Vice President Kamala Harris. I want to meet Rob McPherson, he's the Chief Marketing Officer for a local organization. He's registered Republican from media Pennsylvania who told us he's leaning towards voting for you, but his concerns about what he calls shifts in your policy positions. Rob. Thank you. Thank you for being here, Vice President Harris. So welcome to Delco. Thank you. Here in Delco, we pride ourselves in being authentic. And much of what we have seen, much of what you've been saying with regard to issues like law and order and fracking reflect a more centrist view than what people are used to hearing from Kamala Harris, leaving some voters to wonder about the authenticity of your current more moderate positions. Can you talk a little bit about how your positions have shifted and why? Sure. And thank you. So first of all, on fracking, I've been very clear we kind of dispensed with this in 2020. I am not going to ban fracking. I did not as Vice President. In fact, as Vice President, I cast the tie breaking vote that now has opened up more fracking leases. My value on the issue of what we need to do to invest in a clean energy economy and a clean energy future has not changed. But frankly, I now have the experience and perspective of having been Vice President for almost four years. I've traveled the country. I know that we can invest in a clean energy economy and still not ban fracking and still work toward what we need to do to create more jobs and create U.S.-based jobs in a way that will be globally competitive. On the issue of law and order, as you mentioned, I think there's just a whole lot of misinformation. To be honest with you, I have personally prosecuted. Very serious crime. It's how I started my career. I spent most of my career as a prosecutor, not in Washington, D.C. As my first priority had and remains as a first priority to me, the safety of the American people. That has not changed. Sadly, I think that there's a bit of misinformation, if not more than a bit. I'm glad that you raised the subject so that I can address it. But just if you don't mind, let me just finish. I think the spirit of your question is really important and I'm glad you raised it. Our country deserves to have a president of the United States who is not afraid of good ideas and does not stand on pride if a perspective needs to be informed by different points of view to build consensus and to have a common sense approach. I'm never going to shy away from good ideas. And I'm not going to feel the need to have pride associate with a position that I've taken when the important thing is to build consensus to fix problems. I believe in fixing problems. I love fixing problems. And so I pledge to you to be a president who not only works for all Americans, but works on getting stuff done. And that means compromise. And it doesn't mean compromising your values or your principles, but it does mean working to get stuff done. And I pledge to you I will do that. Just to be clear, though, what he's referring to, and you point out to when you're running for vice president in 2020, you were not talking about banning fracking. No, no, Anderson, I pledge that I would not ban fracking. I know. You said you would not ban fracking. Correct. You had said in a 2019 town hall, there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking in 2017. You talked about Medicare for all. You talked about 2019, raised a hand to debate about border crossing should be decriminalized. Are all of those issues, which those are not your positions now, are all those issues that you're saying through consensus and getting stuff done you have evolved on? Well, no, let's take, for example, the issue of Medicare. My point has always been that access to health care should not just be a privilege of those who can afford it. It should be a right for all people. So that is why I have worked on doing what we have done to, one, allow Medicare to negotiate against the big pharmaceutical companies to bring down the cost of prescription medication. We've achieved that in terms of capping the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month, capping the cost of annual prescriptions at $2,000 a year for seniors. But my plan, moving forward, based on that very principle that I've always had, is as president to have that cap be for everyone and not just for our seniors. The work that I have done that has been about recognizing the importance of dealing with border security. That has never changed. As I said, I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations. That I did for years before I ever ran in 2019. I mean, you did raise your hand saying in a debate when asked of border crossing should be decriminalized. But obviously, that is not your position. I never intended, nor do I, will I ever allow America to have a border that is not secure. I believe we need to deal with illegal immigration. There needs to be consequences, which is why part of my plan that I have outlined. And again, please go to comlaharris.com. Sorry to throw a website on you, but why not? And you will see that part of my plan includes what we need to do to actually do more as it relates to putting resources in, including increasing penalties for illegal crossing. And just finally, on fracking, you said you're clear you would not ban it as president. No, I would not ban it as president. You're clear on that. Do you think it is bad for the environment? I think that we have proven that we can invest in a clean energy economy. We can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. We can work on sustaining what we need to do to protect this beautiful earth of ours and not ban fracking. Time is short, so I want to get some more voters in. Tanisha Spall from Lands Down Pennsylvania. She works as an education administration manager for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. Registered Democrat has said she's leaning towards supporting you, has yet to make her final decision. Tanisha, welcome. Thank you, Anderson. Thank you, Madam Vice President, for joining us this evening. Of course. I appreciate that you did acknowledge that we are a country that is faced with problems and issues, with the Supreme Court being plagued with issues. Would you be in favor of expanding the court to say 12, so each justice has only one circuit court other than Chief Justice to assist in making judgments more balanced? Well, to your point, there is no question that the American people increasingly are losing confidence in the Supreme Court, and in large part because of the behavior of certain members of that court and because of certain rulings, including the Dobs decision and taking away a precedent that had been in place for 50 years, protecting a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. So I do believe that there should be some kind of reform of the court, and we can study what that actually looks like, but I do believe. But again, let's just, while you raise the point of the court, understand that again, in 13 days, the American people will decide who is the next President of the United States. In 13 days, you will decide who is sitting in the Oval Office on January 20th. And on one hand, you have in Donald Trump, someone who has increasingly proved himself to be unstable, and who as we have established, and the people close to him have established, he is unfit to serve. Somebody who on January 20th, you can be sure will spend full time like we know, and we've seen the image mentally of him sitting in the dining room off of the Oval Office watching for hours as people violently attack the Capitol. You can be sure because he has said he would weaponize the Department of Justice to go after his political enemies, that you can look at a Donald Trump in the White House after January 20th, sitting in that Oval Office, plotting his revenge. He has talked about the enemies within. We haven't even raised that subject, Anderson. The enemies within. He's talking about the American people. He's talking about journalists, judges, nonpartisan election officials. He has talked about, as John Kelly has talked about, can he send the military after peaceful protesters? And he's going to sit there unstable, unhinged, plotting his revenge, plotting his retribution, creating an enemy's list. I'm going to tell you, my list will be a list of how I address and continue to address the issues that you all are raising this afternoon and evening. It will be a to-do list about how we can impact the American people and lift up the American people and address some of the challenges that we continue to face. Vice President Kamala Harris, thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. And thanks for watching. Thanks to all the voters here. Be sure to join CNN on November 5th for election night in America right here on CNN. Jake Tapper and Aaron Burnett, pick it up right now. Anderson, thank you. You've been watching CNN's Town Hall with Vice President Kamala Harris and undecided voters less than two weeks from the election. A lot of tough questions for the Vice President there. It seemed as though the voters were divided into three basic groups, liberals who had not heard enough from her. Progressives worried that she was not progressive enough. And Republicans who are wary of Donald Trump and wanting to hear more from the Vice President, she focused a lot more on Donald Trump. I think it's fair to say then she did on many specifics in terms of what she would do as president. But she did go into some of her plans for small businesses and the like. Of course, with only 13 days to go and Trump and Harris fighting over these last few undecided voters and in fact trying to get undecided voters to even vote, we'll see whether or not she achieved what she needed to achieve this evening. Dana Bash, your thoughts. Well, I'll just tell you what I'm hearing from people who I have been talking to. And that is that if her goal was to close the deal, they're not sure she did that. And you know, some people have asked, is she being held to a different standard? Maybe. But that's maybe the world that she's living in. And on the question of who she is, people are understanding that a little bit more. But what she will do, the question about her legislative priorities, name one, there wasn't one. You know, some more of her personality and her sort of character questions about your weaknesses or what mistakes did you make, not necessarily the answers there. Having said that, any time that she can be in front of an audience and interacting with voters is a win as far as her campaign goes. And they are very happy about that. I thought her drawing the contrast with Trump, something that she has been really trying to do in the last several weeks that we've seen where she's gone after him is unstable, unfit for the presidency, saying he doesn't belong behind the seal of the office anymore after he suggested terminating the Constitution. She had a new angle for that tonight. And that's because of John Kelly, his former chief of staff coming out with his on the record comments yesterday, saying he met the definition of a fascist and that he's admired Hitler. That was something that she was within seconds of taking the stage. And that first question from Anderson, where she said that, yes, she agrees Trump is a fascist, where she took that moment and tried to really sharpen it and make news out of it from where, you know, she's been talking about this for weeks, but tried to draw that contrast even further for a lot of people, including the people in this audience who are undecided and maybe have not heard those comments or aren't familiar with what John Kelly has been saying. I thought it was really interesting that she came out of the gate, and that was one of the first things that she was talking about the town hall. Although, John, I do wonder, I mean, I think after eight years of Donald Trump, people are aware of Donald Trump's persona, his proclivity for controversy, his potential to offend and the like. And I wonder if you think maybe she did too much of what Caitlin's talking about. I think that is a fascinating question is how do you balance it, right? How much time do you have with any voter, whether it's in a TV yet or in a town hall in that time that you have, they're watching you. What is your priority, right? This is how much time I have. What do I want to tell you? How do I want to use that time? Donald Trump is more popular than he's been. He's now in this race, his political standing is higher in this race at this point than it was in 2016 or 2020. And so she does need to push Donald Trump down. That is her priority. She does need to push, just try to disqualify Donald Trump, try to remind people who voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, who are thinking about going back to Trump because of their pre-Covid Trump economy nostalgia or he's done the job before and I don't know her. She needs to remind them of that. Then you got to quickly make that pivot. And to Dana's point, I think she did some of it tonight. I was about to say she didn't do enough of it. And then I thought she closed very strongly with the values part. She did the we, we the American people. But that's what voters ask you, who is she? Right? The faith part was interesting. People at home might agree or disagree with it, but she talked about herself, what animates her that she prays sometimes twice a day with a little smile. That's not an issue for voters. That's not taxes. That's not abortion. That's not spending. That's not national security. But it's who is your president when hard things happen. And people just don't know it. That may not be fair to her. She got the nomination in July. She's a vice president. People don't know a lot about their vice president. Some of this has nothing to do with her. It's with her job and who she is. At the end, the value part, we get things done, pragmatic. Why does it have to be so partisan? There was some of it there where I think she fails sometimes is to connect it more to her policies. Right. This may be my fault. I've done ten of these. So I'm always living less prior campaigns and everything. Ten elections. Bill Clinton ran on the same, is running, ran on the same economic agenda she is. I'm going to raise taxes on the rich and I'm going to cut taxes on the middle class. Democratic consultants at the time told them, don't do it. Don't raise taxes. Don't say you're going to raise taxes. They're going to say you're Walter Mondo. They're going to say you're Michael Dukakis. They're going to push you left. He had a brand where he could look people in the eye and say, I'm on your side. I'm fighting for the middle class. Putting people first. That's the connection she has to make to that. You can trust me. She talks about her middle class upbringing. You can trust me to do this. The personal part is sometimes missing. And again, it may be unfair to her to your point about a different standard because as she has not taken the time as vice president or they did not let her take the time as vice president to more develop her brand so that in crunch time you know who she is. Look, I think it was a mixed night. I think she was very strong coming out of the gate and she obviously came with a purpose which she wanted to they want to shine a focus on you know the latest chapter with the Hitler story of John Kelly but generally anti-democratic behavior and the threat that represents and she obviously was well prepared for that. She was very strong on as she has been on abortion rights because she feels passionately about it. She could be clinical on some of these economic issues. She was great on the long-term care for the elderly to help people in the sandwich. The anecdote about helping them bother put on her sweater and your final days. The things that would concern me and then I she did one thing at the end that I thought was really important. The things that would concern me is when she doesn't want to answer a question her habit is to kind of go to word salad city and she did that on a couple of answers. One was on Israel. Anderson asked a direct question would you be stronger on Israel than Trump and there was a seven-minute answer but none of it related to the question he was asking and so you know on certain questions like that on immigration I thought she missed an opportunity because she would acknowledge no concerns about any of the administration's policies and that's a mistake. Sometimes you have to concede things and she didn't concede much but I'll tell you something. John King mentioned Bill Clinton. No one's going to be Bill Clinton but you do want to relate to the people in front of you. She didn't do a lot of that. She didn't ask them questions. She didn't address them particularly so she was giving set pieces too much but she said something at the end that I thought should be actually a frame. If they want to go down the road this is a great frame. She said he'll have an enemy's list. I'll have a to-do list and the to-do list is going to be the concerns you mentioned tonight. I think that is a fundamental argument here. What is your what is there what are their respective motivations and are they and who's going to actually work on the stuff that is going to impact positively on your life. You mentioned the question back and forth with Anderson about Israel and that was actually structurally in the way that this town hall was conducted. She talked about Gaza and then was talking about Israel and anti-Semite. It was back to back which I know stood out to you. Yes I think that she is running into an incredible challenge this cycle of you don't want to alienate Jewish voters who are heartbroken after October 7th. They want the hostages released. They want a ceasefire deal and then the Gaza protesters who are critical in Michigan where you've got a huge Arab population and I worry that the fear to answer either side of the question makes her alienate both communities. I thought that was one of the weaker moments. There's a direct way to answer the issues with anti-Semitism and by the way point them to a history of anti-Semitic actions by the former president dining with an avowed neo-nazi Nick Fuentes. Charlottesville his language after that. I think those could have been a stronger moment. She's clearly very nervous. She didn't bring any of those things up. Yeah those are key constituencies but what I thought she did extraordinarily well is they clearly have data that this John Kelly story the unfitness the danger of Donald Trump is breaking through to people because it was almost like what was the score of the baseball game and it was like well John Kelly in general is warned this. I think that they know that that works with a swath of voters that are still gettable now because that came up in pretty much every other answer to that. She kept going back to it. And I do think it's powerful and I would add personal stories. She shows a humanity that Donald Trump just doesn't have the same ability to convey. He certainly didn't take care of an ailing parent. He hasn't talked about that. He hasn't talked about his faith in great detail. He hasn't cited scripture or pray. Those are her moments where I think you see a little more of her and the public needs that. Yeah look there were flashes. No there weren't. That's for you'll get your turn brother. But there were flashes of the comlet I know who is really a true public servant. She really does work for real people. And in the back of her mind she is trying to figure out how do I solve the problem. She sometimes skips even in person. She'll sometimes skip the human part and get to get to the problem solving part. But there were flashes of it. And I think the question if you're at home trying to figure this out you can ask well you know because you've done this because you've done this better. Your job isn't to do town halls. Your job is to fight for people. Does she seem like somebody who is going to take seriously the problems of ordinary people and try to get an answer. And I think that I think she passed that test. I think that the word salad stuff gets on my nerves. I think that some of the evasions are not necessary. But when she's talking about trying to get you a house I believe her. She's like I'm trying to get you to help for your mama who's sick. I believe her. When she's talking about I'm going to do what I can to bring prices down. I may not agree with those tools but I believe she's going to try to apply them. And so I believe that this is somebody who actually cares about people. And I think that she passed that test tonight. On how she did it and some of that stuff got on my nerves. But I believe that she's going to fight for people. But you just got that as flashes. But then your follow-up seems like a much more of a greater endorsement. Yeah, I'm saying that there were flashes of the person. I didn't get a chance to say it because I interrupted. There are flashes of the person that I know. There are flashes of the person that I know that I've seen as a district attorney at the grassroots level in San Francisco fighting for regular people giving young people an opportunity. So one of those young people by the way is going to Congress. I know this woman and there were flashes of that. And then that's some of those stuff. You know, it got lost in the sauce. I think Republicans would take another hour of Kamala Harris. We just press play. Let her keep going. We'd pay for another hour to let her keep like let her keep not answering the questions. And then Anderson Anderson's asking her why haven't you done it? You've been there for four years. Why have you done it? And the word solid answer she gave to that was just mind boggling. I mean, it's blown up the internet, her answer to that question. I think the things that are troubling for people, her responses to, you know, Van said, what you're going to do reduce costs when they ask her the beginning, we're hurt economically. She said, I'm going to prosecute corporations. Right? That's not going to lower costs. How are you going to make things more better for me? I'm going to prosecute people. Trump bad is not a message that's going to elect, going to get her elected. Trump bad message. I disagree with, I disagree with you, Alyssa there. I don't think it's, I don't think it's going to happen. You're referring to the bringing up the hitler and it brings something else. Say, was she for a wall or she against the wall? I couldn't tell from her answer. Right? You know, Anderson kept asking her, well, listen, you, you, you laughed at the wall, but now it's in your plan. Are you for it or against it? There was so much mishmash in there. I don't know what was going on. I think it's very generous to say that she looks, she showed up. Right? I think the key, if she loses here in this race, people are going to look back and her team is going to say, we should have been doing this from the very get go because reps make you better. Right? And the more you do this, the better you get. She's still not at it. We're 13 days out from an election and everyone's hoping she's going to get better. The Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll while we're, while this was going on. She's losing altitude rapidly, rapidly.",full,6692
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"And welcome. We are live from Chester Township, Pennsylvania, Delaware County, one of the critical counties around Philadelphia that will help determine who wins the White House. Welcome to Sina's Presidential Town Hall with the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. I'm Anderson Cooper. Now in this room, we have assembled a group of 32 Pennsylvania voters who say they are still undecided or persuadable. All of them are registered to vote. Some cast votes for Joe Biden in 2020. Others for Donald Trump. Some didn't vote at all. And for some, this is their first election. Many are leaning right now to one candidate or another, but they all say they have yet to make their final choice. Now we found these voters working with a non-partisan research firm, as well as business and religious groups, universities, and other civic organizations. These voters are asking their own questions tonight selected by CNN to cover a variety of topics. You may see them holding a piece of paper when they're asking their question. It has their question on it. That is a question they have come up with. It has not been edited in any way by CNN. We also invited former President Donald Trump to participate in a town hall or debate. He declined. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Vice President Kamala Harris. Thank you. Thank you so much. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Thanks so much for being with us. We're going to get to the audience in just a second. I want to start by asking you, though, for weeks you have been calling Donald Trump unstable, unhinged. You've called him dangerous. You've quoted General Milley recently who called him a fascist. Today you quoted General Kelly who said that Trump repeatedly praised Hitler. But there are tens of millions of Americans right now who have heard all those things and they don't buy it or even if they do, they're still going to vote for Donald Trump. He's arguably more popular now than ever. You have 13 days to go. What do you say to those voters to convince them? Because some of them are in this room.",chunk_1,362
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"Sure. And I thank you all for taking the time to be here. And you could be doing a number of other things with your time. So this really is proof that we love our country. People are engaged, Anderson, and really want to talk about the issues. And so the issue that you raise, yes, I do believe that Donald Trump is unstable, increasingly unstable, and unfit to serve. And I don't necessarily think that everyone has heard what you and I have heard repeatedly, which is the people who know Donald Trump best, the people who worked with him in the White House, in the Situation Room, in the Oval Office, all Republicans, by the way, who served in his administration, his former chief of staff, his national security advisor, former secretaries of defense, and his vice president have all called him unfit and dangerous. They have said explicitly he has contempt for the Constitution of the United States. They have said he should never again serve as president of the United States. We know that is why Mike Pence is not running with him again, why the job was empty. And then today we learned that John Kelly, a four star Marine general, who was his longest-serving chief of staff, gave an interview recently in the last two weeks of this election talking about how dangerous Donald Trump is. And I think one has to think about why would someone who served with him, who was not political, a four star Marine general, why is he telling the American people now? And frankly, I think of it as he's just putting out a 911 call to the American people, understand what could happen if Donald Trump were back in the White House. And this time we must take very seriously those folks who knew him best and who were career people are not going to be there to hold him back. At least before there were folks who we know what he would say, but they would restrain him. Imagine now Donald Trump in the Oval Office, in the Situation Room. He who has openly admired dictators said he would be a dictator on day one. The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has said he is a fascist to the core of the American people.",chunk_2,391
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"So I think that when the American people reflect, especially those who are undecided, on who you should listen to, don't take my word for it. In fact, go online and listen to John Kelly, his voice, talking about what he thinks of Donald Trump two weeks before the election, because I think we all know to your point, Anderson, it is close, but there are undecided voters who clearly by being here have an open mind, want to talk in a way that is about grounded in issues and fact. And when they hear these facts, I think it compels a lot of people to be concerned about the future of our country with Donald Trump at the lead. You've quoted General Milley calling Donald Trump a fascist. You yourself have not used that word to describe him. Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist? Yes, I do. Yes, I do. And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted. Again, look at their careers. These are not people with the exception, I think of only Mike Pence. These were not politicians. These are career people who have served in the highest roles in national security, who have served as generals in our military, who are highly respected, talking about the person who would be commander in chief, not to mention what we know and what they've told us about how he talks about the military, servicemen and women, referring to them as suckers and losers, how he demeans people who have taken an oath to sacrifice their life for our country. And I do believe Anderson that part of this is why even just this week, I traveled this state and others with Liz Cheney, former Congress member who was a very high ranking Republican. She has endorsed me. Her father, the former vice president of the United States, Dick Cheney is voting for me. Over 400 members of, previous members of the administration from Ronald Reagan to both presidents Bush to Donald Trump even have endorsed my candidacy. And the reason why among them is a legitimate fear based on Donald Trump's words and actions that he will not obey an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.",chunk_3,389
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"He himself has said he would terminate the Constitution of the United States and wants to earn your vote to stand again behind the seal of the president of the United States. No one standing behind the seal of the president of the United States of America should be in that position saying they want to terminate the Constitution of the United States. This is Annalise Keynes. She's from Philadelphia. She works as a fundraiser for Habitat for Humanity. She's registered with no party affiliation. She says she's a Democrat. She's leaning toward voting for you. But says she's yet to make her final decision in part because of the conflict in the Middle East. Annalise? Thank you and good evening, Madam Vice President. My question is as president, what would you do to ensure not another Palestinian dies due to bombs being funded by U.S. tax dollars? So I will say, and I think this is to your point, far too many innocent Palestinian civilians have been killed. It's unconscionable. And we are now at a place where with Sinwar's death, I do believe we have an opportunity to end this war, bring the hostages home, bring relief to the Palestinian people and work toward a two-state solution where Israel and the Palestinians in equal measure have security, where the Palestinian people have dignity, self-determination, and the safety that they so rightly deserve. What do you say to voters who are thinking about supporting a third party candidate or staying on the couch, not voting at all because of this issue? Listen, I am not going to deny the strong feelings that people have. I don't know that anyone who has seen the images who would not have strong feelings about what has happened, much less those who have relatives who have died and been killed. And I know people have talked with people. So I appreciate that. But I also do know that for many people who care about this issue, they also care about bringing down the price of groceries. They also care about our democracy and not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and as a fascist.",chunk_4,365
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"They also care about the fact that we need practical common sense solutions from a leader who is willing to work across the aisle on behalf of the American people and not themselves. They want a president who cares about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body, understanding that we're not trying to change anyone's belief, but let's not have the government telling women what to do with their body. I want you to meet Beth Sandberg. She's a realtor, a mom of four from Balakindwood, Pennsylvania. She's a registered Democrat. Says she's undecided because of concerns about anti-Semitism. Beth. Hi. Thank you for being here. Thank you for remembering we need to bring the hostages home. Of course. The rise of anti-Semitism and violence from, the rise of anti-Semitism and violence from anti-Semitism has risen greatly on college campuses and on our city streets in the last year. How would you combat this growing trend and protect our young adults? Thank you, Beth. You are right. And I will say that we have seen a rise in anti-Semitism. It is something that we have to be honest about and we have to deal with. As Attorney General, I actually published a hate crimes report on a regular basis and anti-Semitism was among the highest forms of hate in our country. And this was before October 7. And we know what we've seen since. Part of what we've got to do is talk with people so that they understand what are the tropes, what are the roots of what we are seeing so that we can actually have people be more understanding. We need to have laws in place that make those who would commit crimes on behalf of anti-Semitism and hate that they pay a serious consequence. We need to have the deterrence so that doesn't happen. We need to ensure that college students are safe in their school and feel safe to be able to go to class. But I'm going to tell you what doesn't help. Again, I invite you to listen and go online to listen to John Kelly, the former Chief of Staff of Donald Trump, who has told us, Donald Trump said, essentially, why aren't my generals like those of Hitler's? Like Hitler, who has referred several times, we've heard the reports for years.",chunk_5,393
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"Do you believe Donald Trump is anti-Semitic? I believe Donald Trump is a danger to the well-being and security of America. He has said that he's casting himself as a protector of Israel. Do you believe you would be more pro-Israel than Donald Trump? I believe that Donald Trump is dangerous. I believe that when you have a president of the United States who has said to his generals, who work for him because he is commander-in-chief, these conversations, I assume, many of them took place in the Oval Office. And if the president of the United States, the commander-in-chief, is saying to his generals, in essence, why can't you be more like Hitler's generals, Anderson? Come on. This is a serious, serious issue. And we know who he is. He admires dictators, sending love letters back and forth with Kim Jong-un. Talks about the president of Russia, and then most recently the reports are that in the height of COVID, when most Americans could not get their hands on a COVID test, Americans were dying by the hundreds a day, he secretly sent COVID tests to the president of Russia for his personal use. So, again, this election in 13 days is presenting the American people with a very significant decision. And on the one side, on this issue of who is going to model what it means to use the bully pulpit of the president of the United States in a manner that in tone, word, and deed, is about lifting up our discourse, fighting against hate, as opposed to fanning the flames of hate which Donald Trump does consistently. I'm going to tell you, we are an incredible country, and we love our country. Y'all wouldn't be here unless we love our country. And there are certain things where we've just got to come together and realize that we do believe in the importance of healthy debate on real issues, but there are certain standards we've got to have. And, you know, another point that even John Kelly talked about, I believe, and many have, is January 6th, where you have the president of the United States defying the will of the people in a free and fair election and unleashing a violent mob who attacked the United States Capitol, 140 law enforcement officers were attacked, some were killed.",chunk_6,392
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"And so I say that to say, the American people deserve to have a president who encourages healthy debate, works across the aisle, not afraid of good ideas wherever they come from, but also maintains certain standards about how we think about the role and the responsibility, and certainly not comparing oneself in a clearly admiring way to Hitler. And we are back with Vice President Kamala Harris. I want to meet Rob McPherson, he's the Chief Marketing Officer for a local organization. He's registered Republican from media Pennsylvania who told us he's leaning towards voting for you, but his concerns about what he calls shifts in your policy positions. Rob. Thank you. Thank you for being here, Vice President Harris. So welcome to Delco. Thank you. Here in Delco, we pride ourselves in being authentic. And much of what we have seen, much of what you've been saying with regard to issues like law and order and fracking reflect a more centrist view than what people are used to hearing from Kamala Harris, leaving some voters to wonder about the authenticity of your current more moderate positions. Can you talk a little bit about how your positions have shifted and why? Sure. And thank you. So first of all, on fracking, I've been very clear we kind of dispensed with this in 2020. I am not going to ban fracking. I did not as Vice President. In fact, as Vice President, I cast the tie breaking vote that now has opened up more fracking leases. My value on the issue of what we need to do to invest in a clean energy economy and a clean energy future has not changed. But frankly, I now have the experience and perspective of having been Vice President for almost four years. I've traveled the country. I know that we can invest in a clean energy economy and still not ban fracking and still work toward what we need to do to create more jobs and create U.S.-based jobs in a way that will be globally competitive. On the issue of law and order, as you mentioned, I think there's just a whole lot of misinformation.",chunk_7,364
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"To be honest with you, I have personally prosecuted. Very serious crime. It's how I started my career. I spent most of my career as a prosecutor, not in Washington, D.C. As my first priority had and remains as a first priority to me, the safety of the American people. That has not changed. Sadly, I think that there's a bit of misinformation, if not more than a bit. I'm glad that you raised the subject so that I can address it. But just if you don't mind, let me just finish. I think the spirit of your question is really important and I'm glad you raised it. Our country deserves to have a president of the United States who is not afraid of good ideas and does not stand on pride if a perspective needs to be informed by different points of view to build consensus and to have a common sense approach. I'm never going to shy away from good ideas. And I'm not going to feel the need to have pride associate with a position that I've taken when the important thing is to build consensus to fix problems. I believe in fixing problems. I love fixing problems. And so I pledge to you to be a president who not only works for all Americans, but works on getting stuff done. And that means compromise. And it doesn't mean compromising your values or your principles, but it does mean working to get stuff done. And I pledge to you I will do that. Just to be clear, though, what he's referring to, and you point out to when you're running for vice president in 2020, you were not talking about banning fracking. No, no, Anderson, I pledge that I would not ban fracking. I know. You said you would not ban fracking. Correct. You had said in a 2019 town hall, there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking in 2017. You talked about Medicare for all. You talked about 2019, raised a hand to debate about border crossing should be decriminalized. Are all of those issues, which those are not your positions now, are all those issues that you're saying through consensus and getting stuff done you have evolved on? Well, no, let's take, for example, the issue of Medicare.",chunk_8,385
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"My point has always been that access to health care should not just be a privilege of those who can afford it. It should be a right for all people. So that is why I have worked on doing what we have done to, one, allow Medicare to negotiate against the big pharmaceutical companies to bring down the cost of prescription medication. We've achieved that in terms of capping the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month, capping the cost of annual prescriptions at $2,000 a year for seniors. But my plan, moving forward, based on that very principle that I've always had, is as president to have that cap be for everyone and not just for our seniors. The work that I have done that has been about recognizing the importance of dealing with border security. That has never changed. As I said, I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations. That I did for years before I ever ran in 2019. I mean, you did raise your hand saying in a debate when asked of border crossing should be decriminalized. But obviously, that is not your position. I never intended, nor do I, will I ever allow America to have a border that is not secure. I believe we need to deal with illegal immigration. There needs to be consequences, which is why part of my plan that I have outlined. And again, please go to comlaharris.com. Sorry to throw a website on you, but why not? And you will see that part of my plan includes what we need to do to actually do more as it relates to putting resources in, including increasing penalties for illegal crossing. And just finally, on fracking, you said you're clear you would not ban it as president. No, I would not ban it as president. You're clear on that. Do you think it is bad for the environment? I think that we have proven that we can invest in a clean energy economy. We can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. We can work on sustaining what we need to do to protect this beautiful earth of ours and not ban fracking. Time is short, so I want to get some more voters in.

2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"She works as an education administration manager for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. Registered Democrat has said she's leaning towards supporting you, has yet to make her final decision. Tanisha, welcome. Thank you, Anderson. Thank you, Madam Vice President, for joining us this evening. Of course. I appreciate that you did acknowledge that we are a country that is faced with problems and issues, with the Supreme Court being plagued with issues. Would you be in favor of expanding the court to say 12, so each justice has only one circuit court other than Chief Justice to assist in making judgments more balanced? Well, to your point, there is no question that the American people increasingly are losing confidence in the Supreme Court, and in large part because of the behavior of certain members of that court and because of certain rulings, including the Dobs decision and taking away a precedent that had been in place for 50 years, protecting a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. So I do believe that there should be some kind of reform of the court, and we can study what that actually looks like, but I do believe. But again, let's just, while you raise the point of the court, understand that again, in 13 days, the American people will decide who is the next President of the United States. In 13 days, you will decide who is sitting in the Oval Office on January 20th. And on one hand, you have in Donald Trump, someone who has increasingly proved himself to be unstable, and who as we have established, and the people close to him have established, he is unfit to serve. Somebody who on January 20th, you can be sure will spend full time like we know, and we've seen the image mentally of him sitting in the dining room off of the Oval Office watching for hours as people violently attack the Capitol. You can be sure because he has said he would weaponize the Department of Justice to go after his political enemies, that you can look at a Donald Trump in the White House after January 20th, sitting in that Oval Office, plotting his revenge.",chunk_10,370
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"He has talked about the enemies within. We haven't even raised that subject, Anderson. The enemies within. He's talking about the American people. He's talking about journalists, judges, nonpartisan election officials. He has talked about, as John Kelly has talked about, can he send the military after peaceful protesters? And he's going to sit there unstable, unhinged, plotting his revenge, plotting his retribution, creating an enemy's list. I'm going to tell you, my list will be a list of how I address and continue to address the issues that you all are raising this afternoon and evening. It will be a to-do list about how we can impact the American people and lift up the American people and address some of the challenges that we continue to face. Vice President Kamala Harris, thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. And thanks for watching. Thanks to all the voters here. Be sure to join CNN on November 5th for election night in America right here on CNN. Jake Tapper and Aaron Burnett, pick it up right now. Anderson, thank you. You've been watching CNN's Town Hall with Vice President Kamala Harris and undecided voters less than two weeks from the election. A lot of tough questions for the Vice President there. It seemed as though the voters were divided into three basic groups, liberals who had not heard enough from her. Progressives worried that she was not progressive enough. And Republicans who are wary of Donald Trump and wanting to hear more from the Vice President, she focused a lot more on Donald Trump. I think it's fair to say then she did on many specifics in terms of what she would do as president. But she did go into some of her plans for small businesses and the like. Of course, with only 13 days to go and Trump and Harris fighting over these last few undecided voters and in fact trying to get undecided voters to even vote, we'll see whether or not she achieved what she needed to achieve this evening. Dana Bash, your thoughts. Well, I'll just tell you what I'm hearing from people who I have been talking to.",chunk_11,368
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"And that is that if her goal was to close the deal, they're not sure she did that. And you know, some people have asked, is she being held to a different standard? Maybe. But that's maybe the world that she's living in. And on the question of who she is, people are understanding that a little bit more. But what she will do, the question about her legislative priorities, name one, there wasn't one. You know, some more of her personality and her sort of character questions about your weaknesses or what mistakes did you make, not necessarily the answers there. Having said that, any time that she can be in front of an audience and interacting with voters is a win as far as her campaign goes. And they are very happy about that. I thought her drawing the contrast with Trump, something that she has been really trying to do in the last several weeks that we've seen where she's gone after him is unstable, unfit for the presidency, saying he doesn't belong behind the seal of the office anymore after he suggested terminating the Constitution. She had a new angle for that tonight. And that's because of John Kelly, his former chief of staff coming out with his on the record comments yesterday, saying he met the definition of a fascist and that he's admired Hitler. That was something that she was within seconds of taking the stage. And that first question from Anderson, where she said that, yes, she agrees Trump is a fascist, where she took that moment and tried to really sharpen it and make news out of it from where, you know, she's been talking about this for weeks, but tried to draw that contrast even further for a lot of people, including the people in this audience who are undecided and maybe have not heard those comments or aren't familiar with what John Kelly has been saying. I thought it was really interesting that she came out of the gate, and that was one of the first things that she was talking about the town hall. Although, John, I do wonder, I mean, I think after eight years of Donald Trump, people are aware of Donald Trump's persona, his proclivity for controversy, his potential to offend and the like.",chunk_12,388
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"And I wonder if you think maybe she did too much of what Caitlin's talking about. I think that is a fascinating question is how do you balance it, right? How much time do you have with any voter, whether it's in a TV yet or in a town hall in that time that you have, they're watching you. What is your priority, right? This is how much time I have. What do I want to tell you? How do I want to use that time? Donald Trump is more popular than he's been. He's now in this race, his political standing is higher in this race at this point than it was in 2016 or 2020. And so she does need to push Donald Trump down. That is her priority. She does need to push, just try to disqualify Donald Trump, try to remind people who voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, who are thinking about going back to Trump because of their pre-Covid Trump economy nostalgia or he's done the job before and I don't know her. She needs to remind them of that. Then you got to quickly make that pivot. And to Dana's point, I think she did some of it tonight. I was about to say she didn't do enough of it. And then I thought she closed very strongly with the values part. She did the we, we the American people. But that's what voters ask you, who is she? Right? The faith part was interesting. People at home might agree or disagree with it, but she talked about herself, what animates her that she prays sometimes twice a day with a little smile. That's not an issue for voters. That's not taxes. That's not abortion. That's not spending. That's not national security. But it's who is your president when hard things happen. And people just don't know it. That may not be fair to her. She got the nomination in July. She's a vice president. People don't know a lot about their vice president. Some of this has nothing to do with her. It's with her job and who she is. At the end, the value part, we get things done, pragmatic. Why does it have to be so partisan? There was some of it there where I think she fails sometimes is to connect it more to her policies.",chunk_13,400
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"Right. This may be my fault. I've done ten of these. So I'm always living less prior campaigns and everything. Ten elections. Bill Clinton ran on the same, is running, ran on the same economic agenda she is. I'm going to raise taxes on the rich and I'm going to cut taxes on the middle class. Democratic consultants at the time told them, don't do it. Don't raise taxes. Don't say you're going to raise taxes. They're going to say you're Walter Mondo. They're going to say you're Michael Dukakis. They're going to push you left. He had a brand where he could look people in the eye and say, I'm on your side. I'm fighting for the middle class. Putting people first. That's the connection she has to make to that. You can trust me. She talks about her middle class upbringing. You can trust me to do this. The personal part is sometimes missing. And again, it may be unfair to her to your point about a different standard because as she has not taken the time as vice president or they did not let her take the time as vice president to more develop her brand so that in crunch time you know who she is. Look, I think it was a mixed night. I think she was very strong coming out of the gate and she obviously came with a purpose which she wanted to they want to shine a focus on you know the latest chapter with the Hitler story of John Kelly but generally anti-democratic behavior and the threat that represents and she obviously was well prepared for that. She was very strong on as she has been on abortion rights because she feels passionately about it. She could be clinical on some of these economic issues. She was great on the long-term care for the elderly to help people in the sandwich. The anecdote about helping them bother put on her sweater and your final days. The things that would concern me and then I she did one thing at the end that I thought was really important. The things that would concern me is when she doesn't want to answer a question her habit is to kind of go to word salad city and she did that on a couple of answers.",chunk_14,390
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,One was on Israel. Anderson asked a direct question would you be stronger on Israel than Trump and there was a seven-minute answer but none of it related to the question he was asking and so you know on certain questions like that on immigration I thought she missed an opportunity because she would acknowledge no concerns about any of the administration's policies and that's a mistake. Sometimes you have to concede things and she didn't concede much but I'll tell you something. John King mentioned Bill Clinton. No one's going to be Bill Clinton but you do want to relate to the people in front of you. She didn't do a lot of that. She didn't ask them questions. She didn't address them particularly so she was giving set pieces too much but she said something at the end that I thought should be actually a frame. If they want to go down the road this is a great frame. She said he'll have an enemy's list. I'll have a to-do list and the to-do list is going to be the concerns you mentioned tonight. I think that is a fundamental argument here. What is your what is there what are their respective motivations and are they and who's going to actually work on the stuff that is going to impact positively on your life. You mentioned the question back and forth with Anderson about Israel and that was actually structurally in the way that this town hall was conducted. She talked about Gaza and then was talking about Israel and anti-Semite. It was back to back which I know stood out to you. Yes I think that she is running into an incredible challenge this cycle of you don't want to alienate Jewish voters who are heartbroken after October 7th. They want the hostages released. They want a ceasefire deal and then the Gaza protesters who are critical in Michigan where you've got a huge Arab population and I worry that the fear to answer either side of the question makes her alienate both communities. I thought that was one of the weaker moments. There's a direct way to answer the issues with anti-Semitism and by the way point them to a history of anti-Semitic actions by the former president dining with an avowed neo-nazi Nick Fuentes.,chunk_15,389
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,Charlottesville his language after that. I think those could have been a stronger moment. She's clearly very nervous. She didn't bring any of those things up. Yeah those are key constituencies but what I thought she did extraordinarily well is they clearly have data that this John Kelly story the unfitness the danger of Donald Trump is breaking through to people because it was almost like what was the score of the baseball game and it was like well John Kelly in general is warned this. I think that they know that that works with a swath of voters that are still gettable now because that came up in pretty much every other answer to that. She kept going back to it. And I do think it's powerful and I would add personal stories. She shows a humanity that Donald Trump just doesn't have the same ability to convey. He certainly didn't take care of an ailing parent. He hasn't talked about that. He hasn't talked about his faith in great detail. He hasn't cited scripture or pray. Those are her moments where I think you see a little more of her and the public needs that. Yeah look there were flashes. No there weren't. That's for you'll get your turn brother. But there were flashes of the comlet I know who is really a true public servant. She really does work for real people. And in the back of her mind she is trying to figure out how do I solve the problem. She sometimes skips even in person. She'll sometimes skip the human part and get to get to the problem solving part. But there were flashes of it. And I think the question if you're at home trying to figure this out you can ask well you know because you've done this because you've done this better. Your job isn't to do town halls. Your job is to fight for people. Does she seem like somebody who is going to take seriously the problems of ordinary people and try to get an answer. And I think that I think she passed that test. I think that the word salad stuff gets on my nerves. I think that some of the evasions are not necessary. But when she's talking about trying to get you a house I believe her.,chunk_16,391
2024-10-23,Town Hall,Harris CNN town hall,chunk,"She's like I'm trying to get you to help for your mama who's sick. I believe her. When she's talking about I'm going to do what I can to bring prices down. I may not agree with those tools but I believe she's going to try to apply them. And so I believe that this is somebody who actually cares about people. And I think that she passed that test tonight. On how she did it and some of that stuff got on my nerves. But I believe that she's going to fight for people. But you just got that as flashes. But then your follow-up seems like a much more of a greater endorsement. Yeah, I'm saying that there were flashes of the person. I didn't get a chance to say it because I interrupted. There are flashes of the person that I know. There are flashes of the person that I know that I've seen as a district attorney at the grassroots level in San Francisco fighting for regular people giving young people an opportunity. So one of those young people by the way is going to Congress. I know this woman and there were flashes of that. And then that's some of those stuff. You know, it got lost in the sauce. I think Republicans would take another hour of Kamala Harris. We just press play. Let her keep going. We'd pay for another hour to let her keep like let her keep not answering the questions. And then Anderson Anderson's asking her why haven't you done it? You've been there for four years. Why have you done it? And the word solid answer she gave to that was just mind boggling. I mean, it's blown up the internet, her answer to that question. I think the things that are troubling for people, her responses to, you know, Van said, what you're going to do reduce costs when they ask her the beginning, we're hurt economically. She said, I'm going to prosecute corporations. Right? That's not going to lower costs. How are you going to make things more better for me? I'm going to prosecute people. Trump bad is not a message that's going to elect, going to get her elected. Trump bad message. I disagree with, I disagree with you, Alyssa there.",chunk_17,386

Say, was she for a wall or she against the wall? I couldn't tell from her answer. Right? You know, Anderson kept asking her, well, listen, you, you, you laughed at the wall, but now it's in your plan. Are you for it or against it? There was so much mishmash in there. I don't know what was going on. I think it's very generous to say that she looks, she showed up. Right? I think the key, if she loses here in this race, people are going to look back and her team is going to say, we should have been doing this from the very get go because reps make you better. Right? And the more you do this, the better you get. She's still not at it. We're 13 days out from an election and everyone's hoping she's going to get better.

They say you can always tell the Morehouse man, but you can't tell him much. But you can trust the Morehouse man to tell you the truth. Georgia, here's what we have to say to those who would doubt our voice, doubt our power, doubt our vote. This party's over. Like my brother Spikes going to tell you, we've been turning out, we've been turning up, but we can't stop now. Georgia, we got 12 days to choose which way our country is going to go from here. Which way our future is going to go from here. That's why I'm so fired up to be here with you. And that's why I'm so proud to support our next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. You don't have to wait until Election Day to show your support. You can go vote early, right now, in any polling place in your county. Showing up at the polls is the only way we can deliver Kamala Harris' future. She's running on a vision to lead our country forward. A vision built on hope, built on faith, and built on opportunity. Built on the belief that we can build a brighter future by lifting each other up and not tearing each other down. She's running on a proven track record of fighting for the people. Standing up to bullies, protecting the most vulnerable and taking on the toughest fights. And we've heard her favorite curse word is a favorite of mine too. But I ain't gonna say that word. But I don't know about you, but that's the kind of president I can stand behind. That's the kind of president I can see leading our country forward. Now, as for the unmentionable, we've seen that horror show before. And there is no way, no how, we gonna make America great again. We are not going back. That's right. That's right. We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. Oh yeah. So, Georgia, we can't let up. We got 12 days to run through the tape. We got to knock on doors. We got to make some calls. We got to get our families, our friends, our neighbors, our neighbors, neighbors, to get out, to turn up and turn up. But most of all, we got to show them all our vote is our voice. Our voice is our power. And our power is how we win. Thank you. We are not going back. You damn right. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Where's Belblat? What's up, George? How you doing? How's it going? It always feels good to come home. I'm a Grady baby. Born right here, March, 20, 1957 in Atlanta. I'm a third generation Spelman Morehouse legacy. And it's homecoming. Power is knowing your past. And right now we're 12 days out from the most pivotal election of our times. There's nowhere else, even Mass Square Garden. I'd rather be here tonight. Or Yankee Stave, we're in the World Series. Because let me tell you, Georgia's where our future is being written. No joke. Georgia, you've been showing up and showing out. Smash into smithereens. Every voter record is left and right. Turn it out in full force. Now, listen to science. I'm dropping science right here. No matter what kind of shenanigans, skull-duggery, and subterfuge, the Okie-dokie, the Flint-Flam, we're not going for that. Are we going for that? Hell no! One more time. One more. Hell to the die! It's coming, it's coming. But you know what, Georgia? We ain't done yet. We've got 12 days. That's a dozen. And we don't have a second to lose. Now, if we want to move forward, not backward, not when we want to fight for the one candidate in this election who's fighting for us, not if we stand with the one candidate who stands up for us, not if we raise our voice for the one who's speaking up for us, our sister, our Harris, the VP. Now, what are we going to do? Almost done. And look, I don't even have to ask, do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know? You already know what time it is. That we don't have a moment to lose. You want to stop that other guy. I don't call him by his name. I call him Agent Orange. You dig? Show me now if we cannot be hoodwinked. Bamboozled. Let us stray. Now, you know where that's from. Power is knowing your past and to know our past is power. And, sisters and brothers, right now is time to choose the direction we want for the future. We get to this side. So we got to wake up. We got to open our eyes. What's at stake? And to quote Parliament Funkadelic, we got to turn this mother out. Now, you know about PFUNC. We have to process like everything is on the line. I'm not exaggerating. This is a life and death situation. We got to wake up. You can't hear me. I'm not starting over.

Everything down that ain't got the faith to stand its ground. Blow away the dreams that tear you apart. Blow away the dreams that break your heart. Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and broken hearties. Well, a dog on Main Street howl, cause they understand if I could take this moment into my hands. Mr. Rainer boy, no I'm a man and I believe in the promise of land. And I believe in the promise of land. And I believe in the promise of land. Land. Land. Land. Land. Land. Land. Land. Land. Land.

Now it's time for some entertainment. Here we go. Music I get up in the evening And I ain't got nothing to say. I'm in the morning I go to bed feeling the same way I ain't nothing but tired Man I'm just tired and bored with myself Hey there baby I could use just a little help now You can't start a fire Without a spark This gun's for hire The unifrig just dancing in the dark Messages keep getting clearer Radio's on and I'm moving around the place Checking my look in the mirror Want to change my clothes My hair, my face Man I ain't getting nowhere Just living in a dump like this There's something happening somewhere Baby I just know there is You can't start a fire You can't start a fire Without a spark This gun's for hire Even if we're just dancing in the dark Sit around getting older There's a joke here somewhere And it's on me Shake this world off my shoulders Come on baby have a laugh on me Stay on the streets of this town And it'll be a car for you up alright Say you gotta stay hungry Well I'm just about starving tonight I'm dying for some action I'm sick of sitting around here Trying to write this book I need a love reaction Come on now baby give me just one look You can't start a fire Sitting around crying over a broken heart This gun's for hire Even if we're just dancing in the dark Can't start a fire Worrying about your little world falling apart This gun's for hire Even if we're just dancing in the dark Even if we're just dancing in the dark Hey baby Thank you Atlanta Kamala Harrison Tim Walts for president and vice president Get out there and vote! Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Well hello Georgia Well listen I just landed on a plane back from Battleground, Pennsylvania but I had to get back to Georgia to welcome the next president of the United States of America Kamala Harris and the next vice president of the United States Tim Walsh to Battleground, Georgia Back in 2021 Georgia literally saved the country and in my best Georgia accent and way let me say that we're fixing to do it again Are you ready to win this election? Hear me tonight I know that we are in the midst of a political election but here the pastor tonight when I say to you that this is more than an election it is a moral moment in America It's really hard to overstate how much is at stake Here's the thing we already know who Donald Trump is that's not what this election is about it's about who are we I still believe in the American people I still believe that the American people at the end of the day are going to embrace that age old American covenant out of many one because we know that we stand together that we are connected that we need each other that we need our neighbors that there are not enemies within we may have differences of opinion Earlier today I was standing with Republicans in Pennsylvania and then later I was standing with brothers you know black men in a barbershop Earlier before that I was standing with students the truth is we need everybody we need our hands on deck are you ready to show up? So So let me defy Baptist gravity and be brief There's a lot of talk these days about what black men are going to do let me speak to that for just a moment Let me say that I do not believe that there's going to be this wave I do not believe that significant numbers of black men are going to vote for the likes of Donald Trump I don't believe that now we are not a monolith there will be some but there won't be this wave after all we know who Donald Trump is we're not confused we know that this is the man who was held accountable by the Justice Department because he wouldn't even rent apartments to black people we know who Donald Trump is we know that this is the man who took out a full page ad in the New York Times and said that five young men of color who had been accused of a heinous crime should receive a death penalty and when it became clear that they were not guilty when the Central Park Five became the exonerated Five he said he still stood by what he said we know who Donald Trump is Donald Trump is this is the man who entered into the political arena on a racist birth or lie that the first African-American president was not born here we know what he was up to he was trying to say you're not one of us but I believe that the American people will reject this hatred or reject this bigotry we understand that we are one people are you ready to stand together and win this election? are you ready to stand on behalf of truth and righteousness and justice? and so let's do the moral work let's do the hard moral work that we will have to do even after November 5th to redeem the soul of our nation I know that we can do it we've seen hard times before we've been through tough struggles before but I believe that we will get this done now there are times when I grow weary all of this hate all of this terrible rhetoric we've been hearing ever since he came now on that elevator public discourse in America has been going down and every now and then I grow weary and when I grow weary I look up and because I'm a preacher I'd love to tell you that I see something profound in the heavens but all I really see is birds flying by but I like to see geese fly why? because geese fly in a v-formation and the one out front who is getting all the glory and all of the sunlight the wind on his face believe it or not the one out front is actually working the hardest but what I like about geese is that when the one out front finally gets tired he just moves further back in the formation and when he moves back she moves up and takes his place and what I like about geese is that when the one out front finally gets tired he just moves further back and when the one out front finally gets tired and when the one out front finally gets tired and when the one out front finally gets tired and when the one out front finally gets tired and when the one out front finally gets tired and when the one out front finally gets tired and when the one out front finally

gets tired and when the one out front finally gets tired and when the one out front finally gets tired and when the one out front finally gets tired and when the one out front finally gets tired and when the one out front finally gets tired and that president is Kamala Harris we want a president that understands like I did in Georgia when I came here I didn't have anything but I had a dream so I worked and against all odds I worked my way to where I am now it was here in Georgia see in Georgia you know what we do we don't sit around and complain we go to work we don't sit around and complain we don't sit around and complain we don't sit around and complain we don't sit around and complain we don't sit around and complain we don't sit around and complain we don't sit around and complain we don't sit around and complain we don't sit around and complain we don't sit around and complain we don't sit around and complain we don't sit around and complain we don't sit around and complain we don't sit around and complain so I get in the car and traffic is stopped and we're riding and we're riding and he's talking to me and for those of you who are old enough to remember Charlie Brown all I heard was I finally said I'm sorry Mr. President but I haven't heard a word you said because I'm in awe of this country what a great country that you could become president of the United States and he turned to me quick as a flash and he said yes but what a great country that you could become Tyler Perry from that moment I went and I bought a bigger studio I bought Fort McPherson Army Base right now where we hire thousands of people are coming through that doors and I don't care what was stacked up against me I don't care I didn't pay attention to that what I paid attention to was how do I help somebody I broke through that door and I laid it down on its side and let it become a ramp so that somebody else can get higher too you want to hear something about an American dream Fort McPherson was once a Confederate Army Base where there were Confederate soldiers trying to plot and plan on how to keep 3.9 million Negroes enslaved now that land is owned by me and I'm going to say thank you for that and I'm going to say thank you and I'm going to say thank you and I'm going to say thank you and I'm going to say thank you and I'm going to say thank you and I'm going to say thank

going to say thank you and I'm going to say thank you and I'm going to say thank you and I'm going to say thank you and I'm going to say thank you because his wife is in politics and you don't agree with her and two things can be true at once I am not the kind of man that Glory End celebrates, enjoy, or laugh at a 78 year old former president almost meeting his death at an assassin's bullet in Butler's, Pennsylvania it's not right it's about decency America and I think you agree with me but I am the kind of American that believes if you lose an election that you honor the constitutional peaceful transfer of power and judging by your reaction I believe Kamala is right we have more in common than what separates us as I'm closing here I just want to talk about that quote I used to wrap up in my grandmother's car that quote that my grandmother gave me that quote was a tapestry of beautiful pieces but I completely ignored it I didn't think it was worth anything because she had made it from all of these stitches and gave it to me as a gift and I was walking past this antique store years later and I saw one in the window and I go wow that's a beautiful quote it reminds me of my grandmother so I walk in and talk to the lady she started explaining to me that each patch meant this because of the woman who made it so when I think about America I think about my grandmother's quote we are all shapes sizes and colors but we are one and it was so important for me to stand with a candidate who understands that we as America we are a quilt and I could never stand with a candidate who wants America to be a sheet so today I voted for Kamala Harris and Georgia was only about 11,400 votes that separated Trump and Biden so every vote counts so I stand here full-throated with my full chest begging you, imploring you let's get out and make Kamala Harris the 47th president of the united united united united states of America thank you everybody God bless you I'm done with all I have to say except one thing that man who was in the beast with me I'm done with all I have to say I'm done with all I have to say I'm done with all I have to say I'm done with all I have

to say I mean have you seen Don Trebley he out there giving two hour speeches just word salad said the other day January 6 was a day of love he said that like it was Woodstock or Coachella if your grandpa was acting like this you'd call up your brother call up your cousin you say hey have you noticed grandpa he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now some of the people who know Donald Trump best have been saying in no uncertain terms that he should not be president again the other day General John Kelly Donald Trump's former chief of staff said that Trump told him he wanted his generals to be like Hitler's generals now don't boom vote now I want to explain that in politics a good rule of thumb is don't say you want to do anything like Hitler you know that's just good political advice but it is useful because it gives us a window into how Donald Trump thinks and John Kelly isn't the only one saying this two of his defense secretaries people who worked for him said the same thing his chairman of the joint chiefs of staff that is the top of the top brass in our military said he is dangerous now I happen to know John Kelly and Mark Miller they served under me when I was commander in chief these are serious people this is a decorated soldier and marine who served in battle they are not quote unquote woke liberals they are people who have never in the past even talked about politics because they believe that the military should be above politics but the reason they are speaking up is because they have seen that in Donald Trump's mind the military does not exist to serve the constitution or the American people he doesn't see being commander in chief as a solemn sacred responsibility just like everything else he thinks the military exists to do his bidding to serve his interests he said if he is elected he will use that military to go after quote the enemy within which he defines as anybody who criticizes him or refuses to bend the knee he can't handle that and unlike last time unlike the first time he won't have people like John Kelly around to stop him he will be surrounded by people who are just as loony as he is and who will let him do what he wants and so my question to you Georgia is how is any of that going to help you we do not need four years of a wannabe king a wannabe dictator running around trying to punish his enemies that's not what you need in your life America is ready to turn the page we are ready for a better story Georgia we're ready for a president Kamala Harris and the good news is that Kamala Harris is ready for the job this is a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice who need a champion Kamala wasn't born into privilege she was raised in a middle class family she worked at McDonald's when she was in college to pay her expenses she didn't pretend to work at McDonald's when it was closed for a photo op she actually cares what people are going through because she's seen it in her own family in her own life as a prosecutor Kamala stood up for children who had been victims of sexual abuse as attorney general of California fought the big banks and for-profit colleges secured billions of dollars for people after they had been scammed after the home mortgage crisis Kamala pushed me and my administration hard to make sure homeowners got a fair settlement it didn't matter that I was a democrat I did not done doors for my campaign and I was- she was not going to let anybody stop her from winning as much relief as possible for families who deserved it so the- the point I'm making if you elect Kamala Harris she will not be focused on her problems her ego, her money she's going to be focused on you she's going to be focused on you Kamala Kamala understands that too many folks here in Georgia and across the country are struggling to pay the bills now understand wages are steadily growing unemployment is low inflation is finally slowing but we all know the price of everything from housing to healthcare to groceries is still too high and it hurts she understands that the question is who's really going to do something about it so Donald Trump's plan is to give another massive tax cut to billionaires and big corporations because he was a reality star on The Apprentice there's some folks who think well I don't know he's a business man he must know something about the economy I- I- I've heard people say this right I'll talk to him why- why would you think about voting for this guy well they're all well I remember the economy when he first came in it was pretty good yeah, yeah it was good it was my economy I- I- I had spent I- I- I had spent I had spent eight years cleaning up the mess cleaning up the mess that the Republicans have left me and then I handed over 75 straight months of job growth to Donald Trump and I had spent I had spent eight years cleaning up the mess that the Republicans have left me and then I handed over 75 straight months of job growth to Donald Trump and all he did was give tax cuts to folks who didn't need it drove up the deficit in the process and now he wants to do it again you can't give him credit for that and then I- then I hear the other thing I hear some folks will be like well, Donald Trump sent me a check during the pandemic no no no because I've heard this I know y'all- some of you have heard that hey, let me- let me let me make sure y'all understand this Joe Biden sent you a check during the pandemic just like I gave people relief during the great recession the thing is we didn't put our name on it because it wasn't about feeding our egos it wasn't about advancing our politics it was about helping people that's the difference don't be giving them credit for that come on they sent you a check do not fall for that okie doke don't be bamboozle don't get fooled and don't get fooled when he talks about health care either you asked- you asked Donald Trump what he's going to do to make health care more affordable his only answer is and Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act he doesn't really know why he wants to end it except for the fact that I passed it the problem he's got now is that it's popular and people have gotten health care because of it so couple weeks ago you remember during the vice presidential debate his running mate had the nerve had the hook spot to say that Donald Trump salvaged the Affordable Care Act Donald Trump spent the entire presidency trying to tear that thing down and he couldn't even do that right and now eight years after he was elected when he was asked what were you going to do he says well I've got concepts of a plan for how you replace it now I want you all to think about this for a second let's say your boss on the job gives you an assignment says I need it by Friday Friday rolls around your boss says so did you finish that project I asked you to do and you say well I haven't actually started but I got a concept for a plan or you could try this at home how many did you throw out the trash I have a concept of a plan to throw out the trash how's that going to go over on the couch that's how it'll go over if it wouldn't work for you why should it work for the next president of the United States the good news is that Kamala Harris doesn't have concepts of a plan she got a plan to make your life better she's going to go after corporations that unfairly jack up prices she's going to make it easier to build and buy a home she's going to limit out-of-pocket healthcare costs she's going to give a tax cut to a hundred million middle class families and working Americans and if congress passes a bill to restore the reproductive freedom that women had for nearly 50 years the freedom that Donald Trump bragged about taking away Kamala will sign it into law it's an example of how elections matter and I have to say I get why folks get frustrated with politics I do too sometimes I don't watch cable news because sometimes I get why people block it out it just seems like everybody arguing and fussing but I always tell people look politics it's not going to solve all your problems no president is going to eliminate poverty in one term or eliminate racism because those problems are hard it takes steps a little bit of time but your vote matters because that little bit of a time that incremental improvement that adds up and things can get a little better or they can get a little or a lot worse when I was president we did not solve all problems with our healthcare system but 50 million people getting health insurance that didn't have it before that made a difference with health insurance because of it and I'm going to give you another example when I was president we put together an entire playbook for how to deal with a pandemic because we had dealt with Ebola we had dealt with H1N1 virus we put together a plan and we practiced and we had all the agencies in terms of how you're going to deal with the schools and how we're going to deal with the public health agencies and we put it all together and when Donald Trump came in he gave him that playbook and he I guess dropped it in the dustbin three years later a pandemic hit and I want to be fair listen to me now no matter who was president the pandemic was going to be a huge crisis people were going to get sick people were going to die businesses were going to close there'd be travel restrictions it was a once in a hundred year event but if you look at a country like Canada the per capita death rate during COVID was 60% lower than it was here in the United States so you do the math over a million people died during the pandemic here in the US 60% of over a million that's 600,000 people that's grandparents that's aunts that's uncles, parents workers, friends everybody here was touched by it some people might have been alive if we had had a competent administration who was paying attention and trying to do things better instead of talking about injecting bleach into your arm now you remember that if somebody tells you it doesn't make a difference it will not make things perfect but it does make a difference to have somebody who is competent somebody who sees you somebody who respects you somebody who cares about you somebody who understands your dreams and you need to remind folks who are still on the sidelines that the election is about more than just policies it's about values and it is about character some of you know when I was growing up I didn't have a father in the house but I did have people around me stepfather grandparents teachers, coaches and most of all my mother who tried to teach me the difference between right and wrong who showed me what it meant to be honest and responsible to work hard to treat other people the way I wanted to be treated and look at it sometimes when I was a kid and I didn't always live up to those values even as a young adult but over time I internalized those values and as an adult I said this is what I need to stand on this is my foundation and I suspect most of you grew up the same way and one of the most disturbing things about this election and about Trump's rise in politics is how we seem to have set the values we were we were taught aside how we seem to disregard them how we pretend they don't matter when Donald Trump lies about about hurricane aid you've got a hurricane in North Carolina people desperate and he and his vice president candidate deliberately circulate rumors that money is being given to illegal aliens illegal immigrants as opposed to people who are desperate when he when he cheats or shows utter disregard for our constitution when he calls service members who died in battle losers or fellow citizens vermin people make excuses for they act like it's okay as long as their side wins and I've noticed this especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior is a sign of strength that macho you know I'm gonna own these folks I'm gonna put them down I am here to tell you that is not what real strength is it never has been real strength is about working hard and taking responsibility and telling the truth even when it's inconvenient real strength is about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can't always stand up for themselves that's what we should want in our daughters and our sons and that's what I want to see in the president of the United States of America and the good news is we've got a candidate to vote for in this election who demonstrates that kind of character who knows what real strength looks like who will set a good example and do the right thing and lead this country better than she found it that is what this election is about and that is why it is my honor to introduce my friend the next president of the United States of America

They say you can always tell the Morehouse man, but you can't tell him much. But you can trust the Morehouse man to tell you the truth. Georgia, here's what we have to say to those who would doubt our voice, doubt our power, doubt our vote. This party's over. Like my brother Spikes going to tell you, we've been turning out, we've been turning up, but we can't stop now. Georgia, we got 12 days to choose which way our country is going to go from here. Which way our future is going to go from here. That's why I'm so fired up to be here with you. And that's why I'm so proud to support our next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. You don't have to wait until Election Day to show your support. You can go vote early, right now, in any polling place in your county. Showing up at the polls is the only way we can deliver Kamala Harris' future. She's running on a vision to lead our country forward. A vision built on hope, built on faith, and built on opportunity. Built on the belief that we can build a brighter future by lifting each other up and not tearing each other down. She's running on a proven track record of fighting for the people. Standing up to bullies, protecting the most vulnerable and taking on the toughest fights. And we've heard her favorite curse word is a favorite of mine too. But I ain't gonna say that word. But I don't know about you, but that's the kind of president I can stand behind. That's the kind of president I can see leading our country forward. Now, as for the unmentionable, we've seen that horror show before. And there is no way, no how, we gonna make America great again. We are not going back. That's right. That's right. We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. Oh yeah. So, Georgia, we can't let up. We got 12 days to run through the tape. We got to knock on doors. We got to make some calls. We got to get our families, our friends, our neighbors, our neighbors, neighbors, to get out, to turn up and turn up.",chunk_1,406

I'm a Grady baby. Born right here, March, 20, 1957 in Atlanta. I'm a third generation Spelman Morehouse legacy. And it's homecoming. Power is knowing your past. And right now we're 12 days out from the most pivotal election of our times. There's nowhere else, even Mass Square Garden. I'd rather be here tonight. Or Yankee Stave, we're in the World Series. Because let me tell you, Georgia's where our future is being written. No joke. Georgia, you've been showing up and showing out. Smash into smithereens. Every voter record is left and right. Turn it out in full force. Now, listen to science. I'm dropping science right here. No matter what kind of shenanigans, skull-duggery, and subterfuge, the Okie-dokie, the Flint-Flam, we're not going for that. Are we going for that? Hell no! One more time. One more. Hell to the die! It's coming, it's coming. But you know what, Georgia? We ain't done yet. We've got 12 days. That's a dozen. And we don't have a second to lose. Now, if we want to move forward, not backward, not when we want to fight for the one candidate in this election who's fighting for us, not if we stand with the one candidate who stands up for us, not if we raise our voice for the one who's speaking up for us, our sister, our Harris, the VP.

Hear me tonight I know that we are in the midst of a political election but here the pastor tonight when I say to you that this is more than an election it is a moral moment in America It's really hard to overstate how much is at stake Here's the thing we already know who Donald Trump is that's not what this election is about it's about who are we I still believe in the American people I still believe that the American people at the end of the day are going to embrace that age old American covenant out of many one because we know that we stand together that we are connected that we need each other that we need our neighbors that there are not enemies within we may have differences of opinion Earlier today I was standing with Republicans in Pennsylvania and then later I was standing with brothers you know black men in a barbershop Earlier before that I was standing with students the truth is we need everybody we need our hands on deck are you ready to show up? So So let me defy Baptist gravity and be brief There's a lot of talk these days about what black men are going to do let me speak to that for just a moment Let me say that I do not believe that there's going to be this wave I do not believe that significant numbers of black men are going to vote for the likes of Donald Trump I don't believe that now we are not a monolith there will be some but there won't be this wave after all we know who Donald Trump is we're not confused we know that this is the man who was held accountable by the Justice Department because he wouldn't even rent apartments to black people we know who Donald Trump is we know that this is the man who took out a full page ad in the New York Times and said that five young men of color who had been accused of a heinous crime should receive a death penalty and when it became clear that they were not guilty when the Central Park Five became the exonerated Five he said he still stood by what he said we know who Donald Trump is Donald Trump is this is the man who entered into the political arena on a racist birth or lie that the first African-American president was not born here we know what he was up to he was trying to say you're not one of us but I believe that the American people will reject this hatred or reject this bigotry we understand that we are one people are you ready to stand together and win this election? are you ready to stand on behalf of truth and righteousness and justice? and so let's do the moral work let's do the hard moral work that we will have to do even after November 5th to redeem the soul of our nation I know that we can do it we've seen hard times before we've been through tough struggles before but I believe that we will get this done now there are times when I grow weary all of this hate all of this terrible rhetoric we've been hearing ever since he came now on that elevator public discourse in America has been going down and every now and then I grow weary and when I grow weary I look up and because I'm a preacher I'd love to tell you that I see something profound in the heavens but all I really see is birds flying by but I like to see geese fly why? because geese fly in a v-formation and the one out front who is getting all the glory and all of the sunlight the wind on his face believe it or not the one out front is actually working the hardest but what I like about geese is that when the one out front finally gets tired he just moves further back in the formation and when he moves back she moves up and takes his place and what I like about

McPherson Army Base right now where we hire thousands of people are coming through that doors and I don't care what was stacked up against me I don't care I didn't pay attention to that what I paid attention to was how do I help somebody I broke through that door and I laid it down on its side and let it become a ramp so that somebody else can get higher too you want to hear something about an American dream Fort McPherson was once a Confederate Army Base where there were Confederate soldiers trying to plot and plan on how to keep 3.9 million Negroes enslaved now that land is owned by me

say thank you and I'm going to say thank you and I'm going to say thank you and I'm going to say thank you and I'm going to say thank you and I'm going to say thank you because his wife is in politics and you don't agree with her and two things can be true at once I am not the kind of man that Glory End celebrates, enjoy, or laugh at a 78 year old former president almost meeting his death at an assassin's bullet in Butler's, Pennsylvania it's not right it's about decency America and I think you agree with me but I am the kind of American that believes if you lose an election that you honor the constitutional peaceful transfer of power and judging by your reaction I believe Kamala is right we have more in common than what separates us as I'm closing here I just want to talk about that quote I used to wrap up in my grandmother's car that quote that my grandmother gave me that quote was a tapestry of beautiful pieces but I completely ignored it I didn't think it was worth anything because she had made it from all of these stitches and gave it to me as a gift and I was walking past this antique store years later and I saw one in the window and I go wow that's a beautiful quote it reminds me of my grandmother so I walk in and talk to the lady she started explaining to me that each patch meant this because of the woman who made it so when I think about America I think about my grandmother's quote we are all shapes sizes and colors but we are one and it was so important for me to stand with a candidate who understands that we as America we are a quilt and I could never stand with a candidate who wants America to be a sheet so today I voted for Kamala Harris and Georgia was only about 11,400 votes that separated Trump and Biden so every vote counts so I stand here full-throated with my full chest begging you, imploring you let's get out and make Kamala Harris the 47th president of the united united united united states of America thank you everybody God bless you I'm done with all I have to say except one thing that man who was in the beast with me I'm done with all I have to say I'm done with all I have to say I'm done with all I have to say I'm done with

with all I have to say I mean have you seen Don Trebley he out there giving two hour speeches just word salad said the other day January 6 was a day of love he said that like it was Woodstock or Coachella if your grandpa was acting like this you'd call up your brother call up your cousin you say hey have you noticed grandpa he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now he acting kind of funny right now some of the people who know Donald Trump best have been saying in no uncertain terms that he should not be president again the other day General John Kelly Donald Trump's former chief of staff said that Trump told him he wanted his generals to be like Hitler's generals now don't boom vote now I want to explain that in politics a good rule of thumb is don't say you want to do anything like Hitler you know that's just good political advice but it is useful because it gives us a window into how Donald Trump thinks and John Kelly isn't the only one saying this two of his defense secretaries people who worked for him said the same thing his chairman of the joint chiefs of staff that is the top of the top brass in our military said he is dangerous now I happen to know John Kelly and Mark Miller they served under me when I was commander in chief these are serious people this is a decorated soldier and marine who served in battle they are not quote unquote woke liberals they are people who have never in the past even talked about politics because they believe that the military should be above politics but the reason they are speaking up is because they have seen that in Donald Trump's mind the military does not exist to serve the constitution or the American people he doesn't see being commander in chief as a solemn sacred responsibility just like everything else he thinks the military exists to do his bidding to serve his interests he said if he is elected he will use that military to go after quote the enemy within which he defines as anybody who criticizes him or refuses to bend the knee he can't handle that and unlike last time unlike the first time he won't have people like John Kelly around to stop him he will be surrounded by people who are just as loony as he is and who will let him do what he wants and so my question to you Georgia is how is any of that going to help you we do not need four years of a wannabe king a wannabe dictator running around trying to punish his enemies that's not what you need in your life America is ready to turn the page we are ready for a better story Georgia we're ready for a president Kamala Harris and the good news is that Kamala Harris is ready for the job this is a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice who need a champion Kamala wasn't born into privilege she was raised in a middle class family she worked at McDonald's when she was in college to pay her expenses she didn't pretend to work at McDonald's when it was closed for a photo op she actually cares what people are going through because she's seen it in her own family in her own life as a prosecutor Kamala stood up for children who had been victims of sexual abuse as attorney general of California fought the big banks and for-profit colleges secured billions of dollars for people after they had been scammed after the home mortgage crisis Kamala pushed me and my administration hard to make sure homeowners got a fair settlement it didn't matter that I was a democrat I did not done doors for my campaign and I was- she was not going to let anybody stop her from winning as much relief as possible for families who deserved it so the- the point I'm making if you elect Kamala Harris she will not be focused on her problems her ego, her money she's going to be focused on you she's going to be focused on you Kamala Kamala understands that too many folks here in Georgia and across the country are struggling to pay the bills now understand wages are steadily growing unemployment is low inflation is finally slowing but we all know the price of everything from housing to healthcare to groceries is still too high and it hurts she understands that the question is who's really going to do something about it so Donald Trump's plan is to give another massive tax cut to billionaires and big corporations because he was a reality star on The Apprentice there's some folks who think well I don't know he's a business man he must know something about the economy I- I- I've heard people say this right I'll talk to him why- why would you think about voting for this guy well they're all well I remember the economy when he first came in it was pretty good yeah, yeah it was good it was my economy I- I- I had spent I- I- I had spent I had spent eight years cleaning up the mess cleaning up the mess that the Republicans have left me and then I handed over 75 straight months of job growth to Donald Trump and I had spent I had spent eight years cleaning up the mess that the Republicans have left me and then I handed over 75 straight months of job growth to Donald Trump and all he did was give tax cuts to folks who didn't need it drove up the deficit in the process and now he wants to do it again you can't give him credit for that and then I- then I hear the other thing I hear some folks will be like well, Donald Trump sent me a check during the pandemic no no no because I've heard this I know y'all- some of you have heard that hey, let me- let me let me make sure y'all understand this Joe Biden sent you a check during the pandemic just like I gave people relief during the great recession the thing is we didn't put our name on it because it wasn't about feeding our egos it wasn't about advancing our politics it was about helping people that's the difference don't be giving them credit for that come on they sent you a check do not fall for that okie doke don't be bamboozle don't get fooled and don't get fooled when he talks about health care either you asked- you asked Donald Trump what he's going to do to make health care more affordable his only answer is and Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act he doesn't really know why he wants to end it except for the fact that I passed it the problem he's got now is that it's popular and people have gotten health care because of it so couple weeks ago you remember during the vice presidential debate his running mate had the nerve had the hook spot to say that Donald Trump salvaged the Affordable Care Act Donald Trump spent the entire presidency trying to tear that thing down and he couldn't even do that right and now eight years after he was elected when he was asked what were you going to do he says well I've got concepts of a plan for how you replace it now I want you all to think about this for a second let's say your boss on the job gives you an assignment says I need it by Friday Friday rolls around your boss says so did you finish that project I asked you to do and you say well I haven't actually started but I got a concept for a plan or you could try this at home how many did you throw out the trash I have a concept of a plan to throw out the trash how's that going to go over on the couch that's how it'll go over if it wouldn't work for you why should it work for the next president of the United States the good news is that Kamala Harris doesn't have concepts of a plan she got a plan to make your life better she's going to go after corporations that unfairly jack up prices she's going to make it easier to build and buy a home she's going to limit out-of-pocket healthcare costs she's going to give a tax cut to a hundred million middle class families and working Americans and if congress passes a bill to restore the reproductive freedom that women had for nearly 50 years the freedom that Donald Trump bragged about taking away Kamala will sign it into law it's an example of how elections matter and I have to say I get why folks get frustrated with politics I do too sometimes I don't watch cable news because sometimes I get why people block it out it just seems like everybody arguing and fussing but I always tell people look politics it's not going to solve all your problems no president is going to eliminate poverty in one term or eliminate racism because those problems are hard it takes steps a little bit of time but your vote matters because that little bit of a time that incremental improvement that adds up and things can get a little better or they can get a little or a lot worse when I was president we did not solve all problems with our healthcare system but 50 million people getting health insurance that didn't have it before that made a difference with health insurance because of it and I'm going to give you another example when I was president we put together an entire playbook for how to deal with a pandemic because we had dealt with Ebola we had dealt with H1N1 virus we put together a plan and we practiced and we had all the agencies in terms of how you're going to deal with the schools and how we're going to deal with the public health agencies and we put it all together and when Donald Trump came in he gave him that playbook and he I guess dropped it in the dustbin three years later a pandemic hit and I want to be fair listen to me now no matter who was president the pandemic was going to be a huge crisis people were going to get sick people were going to die businesses were going to close there'd be travel restrictions it was a once in a hundred year event but if you look at a country like Canada the per capita death rate during COVID was 60% lower than it was here in the United States so you do the math over a million people died during the pandemic here in the US 60% of over a million that's 600,000 people that's grandparents that's aunts that's uncles, parents workers, friends everybody here was touched by it some people might have been alive if we had had a competent administration who was paying attention and trying to do things better instead of talking about injecting bleach into your arm now you remember that if somebody tells you it doesn't make a difference it will not make things perfect but it does make a difference to have somebody who is competent somebody who sees you somebody who respects you somebody who cares about you somebody who understands your dreams and you need to remind folks who are still on the sidelines that the election is about more than just policies it's about values and it is about character some of you know when I was growing up I didn't have a father in the house but I did have people around me stepfather grandparents teachers, coaches and most of all my mother who tried to teach me the difference between right and wrong who showed me what it meant to be honest and responsible to work hard to treat other people the way I wanted to be treated and look at it sometimes when I was a kid and I didn't always live up to those values even as a young adult but over time I internalized those values and as an adult I said this is what I need to stand on this is my foundation and I suspect most of you grew up the same way and one of the most disturbing things about this election and about Trump's rise in politics is how we seem to have set the values we were we were taught aside how we seem to disregard them how we pretend they don't matter when Donald Trump lies about about hurricane aid you've got a hurricane in North Carolina people desperate and he and his vice president candidate deliberately circulate rumors that money is being given to illegal aliens illegal immigrants as opposed to people who are desperate when he when he cheats or shows utter disregard for our constitution when he calls service members who died in battle losers or fellow citizens vermin people make excuses for they act like it's okay as long as their side wins and I've noticed this especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior is a sign of strength that macho you know I'm gonna own these folks I'm gonna put them down I am here to tell you that is not what real strength is it never has been real strength is about working hard and taking responsibility and telling the truth even when it's inconvenient real strength is about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can't always stand up for themselves that's what we should want in our daughters and our sons and that's what I want to see in the president of the United States of America and the good news is we've got a candidate to vote for in this election who demonstrates that kind of character who knows what real strength looks like who will set a good example and do the right thing and lead this country better than she found it that is what this election is about and that is why it is my honor to introduce my friend the next

And we are saying... We're at a warm Texas welcome. I thank you all so very much. And I thank you, and I thank my friends for reminding us of exactly what we are fighting for in this campaign. We are fighting for freedom! Freedom! Freedom! It's Andrea and everyone here tonight whose lives have been impacted by these Trump abortion bans in this moment. I thank you for sharing your stories and for your courage. It is an honor to be here with so many leaders and all of you. It was taken a time out of the wrongest times to be here this evening so we can as a community of people, as people who love our country, be clear, sound strong, stand in favor of the freedom of every woman to make decisions about our country. Freedom! I also want to thank another subcontractor here including Colin Allred. I'm counting on you to send it to the United States Senate so we can hear right to her. It's all the elected officials and community leaders that thank you all. I thank you all. Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! We have a lot of work to do. We will not get distracted. So this is Texas. We have 11 days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. Voting is already started and we know this will be a tight race until the very end. So here's the thing. Okay, so we got work to do. We got work to do. We got work to do. And I love that there's so much enthusiasm. Let's talk about the work we've got to do. Because we got 11 days to see this through and we will win. And we will win and we will win because we know and understand what is at stake. We are 11 days out from an election that will decide the future of America including the freedom of every woman that makes the citizens of our own body and her reproductive freedom. And everyone here tonight is here because we are about fighting for our future and not letting some people take us back. Because we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. And in America we know freedom is not to be given. It is not to be bestowed. It is ours by right. And we are prepared to fight for it. Because we understand the stakes and moving forward we understand that what we must do is Texas is right here. You are ground zero in the fight for reproductive freedom. We must be loud. We must organize. We must mobilize. We must energize the people. Because you are now Texas is home to one of the most restrictive abortion bans in our country. Texas abortion is banned from the point of possession. You know what? Just turn them to that small rally down the street. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We know what's happening here in Texas. Doctors and nurses to go to prison for life simply for providing reproductive care. Think about that. Life in prison for healthcare providers for doing what they think is in their patients best interest. You know what? The beauty of our campaign is reminding us democracy. And what we know here in Texas is that there are some who would distract from the fact that Texas has a law now that offers a cash bounty for turning in someone who merely helps a friend or family member get the care they need. In Texas, the law provides for prison for life, for healthcare providers, for doing what they believe is in the best interest of their patient. In some counties in Texas, they have passed travel bans to prevent women from going to other states to receive care. These are the states. And we know how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court. With his taxion, they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. And now for the 20 states have a Trump abortion ban. Now one in three American women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, including Texas and every state in the South except for Virginia. And many of these bans are causing care to be denied until a woman is at death's door. Many have no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith, or deeply help least to agree the government should not be telling the question to the public. If she chooses to talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her mother, not the government, but some people up in the state legislator. Tell her, let's give her that interest when she knows within her own interest. And let us recognize these same people, Texasown, these same people who have argued that these Trump abortion bans are in the best interest of women and children, do look at their records. They tend to be in states with the highest rate of maternal mortality in the country. For decades, these extremist leaders who have neglected prenatal care, maternity care, and postpartum care, and who now after continuously failing to support women and children, claim to care about women and children. Well, I have a question for them. Where have you been? Where have you been? Where have you been when it comes to prioritizing care for women and children? Where have you been when it comes to helping pregnant women and new mothers? Where have you been when it comes to affordable child care? And do know, many of these same extremist leaders have also refused to extend child tax credit, which lifted half of America's children out of poverty. They who have blocked proposals to lower child care costs for working parents, they who have tried to cut, wick and snap the low income mothers and their children, the hypocrisy abounds, and here's what else is happening. These bans are driving doctors out of states like Texas, Idaho, Georgia, and North Carolina, leaving women who are already living in maternity care desert, meaning there is no maternity care anywhere near them, leaving them with even fewer options. And since Trump abortion bans, fewer medical students are choosing to specialize in women's housing. Over these past two years, the impact of Trump abortion bans has been devastating. We see the horrific reality that women and families face every single day, and the stories are vivid, they are difficult to hear, they are difficult to tell. For example, here in Texas, can we roll the tape? Four years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it. The Trump abortion bans, the law just described, all of which lead to death because of conservative, implemented laws. I had to fight and beg to get care that I needed. Because I wasn't permitted to have an abortion, I nearly died on their watch. If I had not been able to go out of state to get an abortion in Colorado, my happy, healthy son, Henry, would not be here today. They took two liters of infected fluid from my abdomen, and the infection was so severe that I almost died. I was to stay pregnant and deliver a baby that would suffocate in my arms. One of the Roe v. Wade, I did a great thing. A great thing. There is nothing great about what happened to women like Kate Cosby, who was heartbroken to learn her much-wanted pregnancy was not viable. Heartbroken, when her doctors told her if she remained pregnant, she would be risking her own life or her ability to have children in the future. But the Attorney General of Texas... Frightened, if Kate's doctors helped terminate her pregnancy, they would be criminally prosecuted. So Kate was forced to flee the state to get the care she needed. It was him, Kate and Joshua, who was turned away from not one, but two emergency rooms along this corridor. She was bleeding. She was in pain. But because of a Trump abortion ban, doctors would not treat her. Because if they did, they would have faced 15 years in prison. And so Kate landed at the local home where she went through the pain of a miscarriage for more than a month. And trying the whole time to hide her pain from her four-year-old daughter. We know that women have died because of Trump abortion ban. Here today is Tenette Williams, the mother of Amber Nicole Thurman. A vibrant, we must keep her name, Amber Nicole Thurman. I promise the mother I will keep her name. A 5-year-old 28-year-old mother of a 6-year-old son who died of preventable death because of Georgia's abortion ban. Now Tenette and her family are courageously sharing Amber's story to make sure we all remember her as more than a statistic. So that we remember Amber was a daughter, a sister, a mother, and that she was loved and that she should be alive today. And listen, we're all here because we know the reality is for every story we hear about, about the suffering because of a Trump abortion ban, there are so many stories we've never heard, an untold number of women and the people who love them, who are silently suffering, women who are being made to feel as though they take something long, as though they are criminals, as though they are alone. And to those women I say and I think I speak on behalf of all of us, we see you and we are here with you. Texas, what is happening across this state and our country is a health care crisis. And Donald Trump is the architect of it. He brags about overturning Roe v. Wade in his own words, quote, I did it and I'm proud to have done it. That's what he said. And one has to ask, proud that women are done, proud that doctors and nurses could be thrown in prison for life, for administering life-saving care, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, and on their hands, they want to get their hands on your medical records, since they put their hands out of their minds. In just four years, President Donald Trump was able to erase half a century of hard-fought progress for women, and now he wants to go even further. He will force all 50 states to track and report on women's miscarriages and abortions, and go after access to contraception and IVF treatment. It's right there in his Project 2025 Google it. And let us be clear, if Donald Trump wins again, he will, then abortion nationwide. And though we are in Texas tonight, I say to the folks who might be watching from home, for anyone watching from another state, know this, if you think you are protected from Trump abortion man, because you live in Michigan, or Pennsylvania, or Nevada, or New York, or California, or any state where voters or legislators have protected reproductive freedom, please know, no one is protected if there is a Trump national abortion ban, and it will outlaw abortion in every single state. Understand that. And he can do it with or without an act of Congress. All that to say, elections matter. And Donald Trump is president again, he will likely get to appoint at least one additional Supreme Court Justice. Remember when we appointed Paul Fred Justice Katanji Brown-Jackson. But if he were re-elected, he'd probably get to appoint one, if not two, members to the United States Supreme Court. At which point Donald Trump will have packed the court with five out of nine justices on that court. Think about that. Who will sit for lifetime appointments shaping your lives and the lives of generations to come. And that is among the many critical contracts in this election. Look, Donald Trump doesn't trust women, but I do. We trust women. We understand the best way. And with Trump and all of the United States Senate, we promise that we will. So if you are going to freeze it up for freedom, I will proudly sign it into law if president of the United States. So to all the friends here, let us remember, momentum is on our side. I know sometimes in Texas folks are like, is it worth it? Is it doesn't make a difference? Yes, it does. You are making a difference and momentum is on our side. You are making a difference. Since Rome was overturned every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, Kansas to California to Kentucky and Michigan, Montana, Vermont and Ohio. The people of America have voted for freedom every time it's been on the ballot. And Austin Day has voted by overwhelming margins from so-called red to the so-called blue states proving this is not a partisan issue. Because Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs understand the decision of whether when and how to build a family is one of the most consequential decisions anyone can make. And we are fighting for an America where no matter who you are, where you live, you can make decisions about your own body for yourself. All of this is to say, reproductive freedom is on the ballot in this presidential election. And in 10 states around the country, including Arizona, Florida and Nevada, and with the work of everyone here, freedom will win. And so I want to take a moment to speak in particular to all the young leaders here in across America. Do we have anybody here? Gen Z? Gen Z? I'm down on you because I'm in love with you. And you are impatient for the change. You know in any way that you may have fewer rights than your mother or your grandmother. You know it is not theoretical. You know it is not political. It is from one experience. And I see you. And I see your power. And I know so many of you are voting for the first time. Can I see your right hand? You have won our leaders! All right, we are headed for our young leaders. That's why, listen to everyone here. We know freedom has never come easy. Never come easy. There has been no moment of our progress as a country that did not come about without a fight. Let's all be clear about that. And we are in the midst of a movement. And everyone here is a leader in that movement. So we do this in remembering those who came before us, those who struggled and sacrificed for our freedoms. They found fellowship and even joy in one another in the fight. They found strength and hope in fighting for our ideals. And that is what we are doing. That is what we are doing because we know weeping may endure for a night. That's so exciting! So Texas election day is an 11 days. Early voting has already begun. Now it is time to start making your plan. Go to Iwillvote.com to get all the information you need. And it is not only the presidency that is on the ballot. There are many important races including common order running. We must know that the parties supported the national abortion ban six times. And the court has said he does not support exceptions even for victims of rape and infest. So let's remember Texas, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. So today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we trust in? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in the promise of America? Are we ready to fight for it? And will we fight for it? We will!",full,3104

Life in prison for healthcare providers for doing what they think is in their patients best interest. You know what? The beauty of our campaign is reminding us democracy. And what we know here in Texas is that there are some who would distract from the fact that Texas has a law now that offers a cash bounty for turning in someone who merely helps a friend or family member get the care they need. In Texas, the law provides for prison for life, for healthcare providers, for doing what they believe is in the best interest of their patient. In some counties in Texas, they have passed travel bans to prevent women from going to other states to receive care. These are the states. And we know how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court. With his taxion, they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. And now for the 20 states have a Trump abortion ban.",chunk_2,392
2024-10-25,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Houston, Texas",chunk,"Now one in three American women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, including Texas and every state in the South except for Virginia. And many of these bans are causing care to be denied until a woman is at death's door. Many have no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith, or deeply help least to agree the government should not be telling the question to the public. If she chooses to talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her mother, not the government, but some people up in the state legislator. Tell her, let's give her that interest when she knows within her own interest. And let us recognize these same people, Texasown, these same people who have argued that these Trump abortion bans are in the best interest of women and children, do look at their records. They tend to be in states with the highest rate of maternal mortality in the country. For decades, these extremist leaders who have neglected prenatal care, maternity care, and postpartum care, and who now after continuously failing to support women and children, claim to care about women and children. Well, I have a question for them. Where have you been? Where have you been? Where have you been when it comes to prioritizing care for women and children? Where have you been when it comes to helping pregnant women and new mothers? Where have you been when it comes to affordable child care? And do know, many of these same extremist leaders have also refused to extend child tax credit, which lifted half of America's children out of poverty. They who have blocked proposals to lower child care costs for working parents, they who have tried to cut, wick and snap the low income mothers and their children, the hypocrisy abounds, and here's what else is happening. These bans are driving doctors out of states like Texas, Idaho, Georgia, and North Carolina, leaving women who are already living in maternity care desert, meaning there is no maternity care anywhere near them, leaving them with even fewer options. And since Trump abortion bans, fewer medical students are choosing to specialize in women's housing. Over these past two years, the impact of Trump abortion bans has been devastating.",chunk_3,393
2024-10-25,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Houston, Texas",chunk,"We see the horrific reality that women and families face every single day, and the stories are vivid, they are difficult to hear, they are difficult to tell. For example, here in Texas, can we roll the tape? Four years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it. The Trump abortion bans, the law just described, all of which lead to death because of conservative, implemented laws. I had to fight and beg to get care that I needed. Because I wasn't permitted to have an abortion, I nearly died on their watch. If I had not been able to go out of state to get an abortion in Colorado, my happy, healthy son, Henry, would not be here today. They took two liters of infected fluid from my abdomen, and the infection was so severe that I almost died. I was to stay pregnant and deliver a baby that would suffocate in my arms. One of the Roe v. Wade, I did a great thing. A great thing. There is nothing great about what happened to women like Kate Cosby, who was heartbroken to learn her much-wanted pregnancy was not viable. Heartbroken, when her doctors told her if she remained pregnant, she would be risking her own life or her ability to have children in the future. But the Attorney General of Texas.. Frightened, if Kate's doctors helped terminate her pregnancy, they would be criminally prosecuted. So Kate was forced to flee the state to get the care she needed. It was him, Kate and Joshua, who was turned away from not one, but two emergency rooms along this corridor. She was bleeding. She was in pain. But because of a Trump abortion ban, doctors would not treat her. Because if they did, they would have faced 15 years in prison. And so Kate landed at the local home where she went through the pain of a miscarriage for more than a month. And trying the whole time to hide her pain from her four-year-old daughter. We know that women have died because of Trump abortion ban. Here today is Tenette Williams, the mother of Amber Nicole Thurman. A vibrant, we must keep her name, Amber Nicole Thurman.",chunk_4,374

A 5-year-old 28-year-old mother of a 6-year-old son who died of preventable death because of Georgia's abortion ban. Now Tenette and her family are courageously sharing Amber's story to make sure we all remember her as more than a statistic. So that we remember Amber was a daughter, a sister, a mother, and that she was loved and that she should be alive today. And listen, we're all here because we know the reality is for every story we hear about, about the suffering because of a Trump abortion ban, there are so many stories we've never heard, an untold number of women and the people who love them, who are silently suffering, women who are being made to feel as though they take something long, as though they are criminals, as though they are alone. And to those women I say and I think I speak on behalf of all of us, we see you and we are here with you. Texas, what is happening across this state and our country is a health care crisis. And Donald Trump is the architect of it. He brags about overturning Roe v. Wade in his own words, quote, I did it and I'm proud to have done it. That's what he said. And one has to ask, proud that women are done, proud that doctors and nurses could be thrown in prison for life, for administering life-saving care, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, for the children, and on their hands, they want to get their hands on your medical records, since they put their hands out of their minds.",chunk_5,623
2024-10-25,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Houston, Texas",chunk,"In just four years, President Donald Trump was able to erase half a century of hard-fought progress for women, and now he wants to go even further. He will force all 50 states to track and report on women's miscarriages and abortions, and go after access to contraception and IVF treatment. It's right there in his Project 2025 Google it. And let us be clear, if Donald Trump wins again, he will, then abortion nationwide. And though we are in Texas tonight, I say to the folks who might be watching from home, for anyone watching from another state, know this, if you think you are protected from Trump abortion man, because you live in Michigan, or Pennsylvania, or Nevada, or New York, or California, or any state where voters or legislators have protected reproductive freedom, please know, no one is protected if there is a Trump national abortion ban, and it will outlaw abortion in every single state. Understand that. And he can do it with or without an act of Congress. All that to say, elections matter. And Donald Trump is president again, he will likely get to appoint at least one additional Supreme Court Justice. Remember when we appointed Paul Fred Justice Katanji Brown-Jackson. But if he were re-elected, he'd probably get to appoint one, if not two, members to the United States Supreme Court. At which point Donald Trump will have packed the court with five out of nine justices on that court. Think about that. Who will sit for lifetime appointments shaping your lives and the lives of generations to come. And that is among the many critical contracts in this election. Look, Donald Trump doesn't trust women, but I do. We trust women. We understand the best way. And with Trump and all of the United States Senate, we promise that we will. So if you are going to freeze it up for freedom, I will proudly sign it into law if president of the United States. So to all the friends here, let us remember, momentum is on our side. I know sometimes in Texas folks are like, is it worth it? Is it doesn't make a difference? Yes, it does.",chunk_6,368
2024-10-25,Rally,"Harris held a rally in Houston, Texas",chunk,"You are making a difference and momentum is on our side. You are making a difference. Since Rome was overturned every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, Kansas to California to Kentucky and Michigan, Montana, Vermont and Ohio. The people of America have voted for freedom every time it's been on the ballot. And Austin Day has voted by overwhelming margins from so-called red to the so-called blue states proving this is not a partisan issue. Because Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs understand the decision of whether when and how to build a family is one of the most consequential decisions anyone can make. And we are fighting for an America where no matter who you are, where you live, you can make decisions about your own body for yourself. All of this is to say, reproductive freedom is on the ballot in this presidential election. And in 10 states around the country, including Arizona, Florida and Nevada, and with the work of everyone here, freedom will win. And so I want to take a moment to speak in particular to all the young leaders here in across America. Do we have anybody here? Gen Z? Gen Z? I'm down on you because I'm in love with you. And you are impatient for the change. You know in any way that you may have fewer rights than your mother or your grandmother. You know it is not theoretical. You know it is not political. It is from one experience. And I see you. And I see your power. And I know so many of you are voting for the first time. Can I see your right hand? You have won our leaders! All right, we are headed for our young leaders. That's why, listen to everyone here. We know freedom has never come easy. Never come easy. There has been no moment of our progress as a country that did not come about without a fight. Let's all be clear about that. And we are in the midst of a movement. And everyone here is a leader in that movement. So we do this in remembering those who came before us, those who struggled and sacrificed for our freedoms.

Are you ready to do this? Are we going to do this? Are we ready to vote? Are we ready to win? It's good to be back. So I want to thank all the incredible leaders who are here. I want to start with your mayor, Parker, where are you mayor? A phenomenal leader. She has been an extraordinary friend. Speaker McClinton, thank you. Representative Dean and Scanlon, thank you. And let's send Bob Casey back to the United States Senate. And to all the community and elected leaders here, I thank you. I had a chance to visit with many of you this afternoon. I thank you for the leadership you provide in so many ways. And I love you back. And everyone here, I thank you. I thank you because you have taken time this afternoon, this Sunday afternoon, out of your busy lives for us to all be here together, under one roof, to make the point that we are all in this together. We are all in this together. And we are all here together because we also understand how high the stakes are at this very moment. Philly, we've got nine days, nine days, nine days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And we know this is going to be a tight race until the very end. So we have a lot of work ahead of us. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And we make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We will win. We will win. And we will win because here's how I think about it. When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. And this election is about two extremely different visions for our nation. One, Donald Trump's who has focused on the past and himself. We are not going back. And here's why. Because we, because we are focused on the future and we are focused on the needs of the American people as opposed to a Donald Trump who spends full time looking in the mirror focused on himself. Okay, you know what, hold on a second. Listen, no, hold on. Hold on. Listen, I want to talk about Gaza for a minute. I want to talk about Gaza for a minute. Okay? We can and we must seize this opportunity to end this war and bring the hostages home. And I will do everything in my power to meet that end. And we are here because we are fighting for our democracy. And we respect the voices of all people. And we've got a job to do in the next nine days to fight for this democracy we love. Nine days. And we understand we have an opportunity before us to turn the page on the fear and the divisiveness that have characterized our politics for a decade because of Donald Trump. We have the ability to turn the page on that same old tired playbook because we are exhausted with it. And we are ready to chart a new way forward and yes we will be joyful in the process. Yes we like to laugh. Yes we know that when you care about the people and you understand what you are fighting for there is joy in that fight. And that is why we are all in this together. We are fighting for our future of our nation where we tap into the ambitions and the aspirations and the dreams of the American people. We are a new generation of leadership that is optimistic and excited about what our nation can do together. And the great thing about living in a democracy as long as we keep it is that we the people have the power to choose the direction of our country and its leadership. The power is with the people. And from the beginning our campaign has been about building coalitions and building community. Look over the next nine days like I said we are going to win that is our highest order but through that process to all the friends here I say let's be intentional about building community. Let's be intentional about building coalitions. Let's be intentional about understanding we all have so much more in common than what separates us. We will be the better for it. That's what our campaign is about because we know we are all in this together. We have so much more in common than what separates us and we are going to fight for the country we love. And that is why we are all here together because we love our country. We love our country. And you got to fight for the thing you love. You got to fight for the thing you love. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, the expression of the love of our country to then fight for its ideals. It is the highest form of patriotism and one of the most powerful ways we do that is with our vote. So, alright, so everybody is here because you are prepared to do the work. So here we are. From now until election day we are going to get out the vote here in Pennsylvania. And if you will give me a minute, I really right now want to speak to the young leaders who are here. Is Jen Z in the house? Who is voting for their first time in the first election? Alright. Here is the thing I love about you young leaders. You know, you are rightly impatient for change. You are rightly impatient. You who have only known the climate crisis. You are leaders in what we need to do to protect our planet. You who grew up with active shooter drills. You know what we have to do to fight for safety in our schools. You who right now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers understand the importance of fighting for the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body. And not have her government tell her what to do. And this is why I love you the young leaders who are here because for you this is not theoretical. This is not political. This is not about some debate. It is about your lived experience. And you are here and I see you because I see your power. And you are here because you know your power. And I am so proud of you. And everyone let us applaud our young leaders, our first time voters. Let's applaud them. Let's applaud them. Let's applaud them. So Philly, we have nine days, nine days to get this done. And for the next nine days, no one can sit on the sidelines. There is too much on the line and we must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what we could have done in these next nine days. So let's spend these next nine days knowing we did everything we could that we connected with each other, with our neighbors. That we went up to perfect strangers in the grocery store and said, you know what? I see you. Let's approach this moment in a way that in the face of a stranger, we see a neighbor. And let's talk with each other about what we have in common. Let's build community. And let's knock on doors. Let's text and call potential voters. Let's reach out to our family and our friends and our classmates and our neighbors. Tell them about the stakes in this election and tell them about their power. So we are going to get folks to the polls and we are going to make our voices heard. And let's give folks some important information. Election day, let's start with the basics. Okay? Election day is Tuesday, November 5th. I'm serious. Everybody's busy. Let's start with that. Let folks know you can vote then or you can vote early from today through Tuesday, October 29th. That's two days from now. So now is the time to vote early. Get it done tomorrow if you can. Go to IWOLVOTE.COM. If you need information about where you vote and if you have received your ballot in the mail, do not wait. Fill it out today. Because the election is here and the choice, Billy, is truly in your hands. The path to victory runs right through all the leaders who are here. To all of you.

And as everybody here knows, this is going to be a tight race until the very end. So we have a lot of work ahead of us. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win, we will win. And we will win because together, and we will win, yes, yes, we can keep going all night. But one of the reasons we will win is because we are all in this together. We are all in this together, people from every walk of life, understanding that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And we here are fighting for the future. We are fighting for the future. And we understand the opportunity that we have before us to turn the page on the fear and divisiveness that have characterized our politics for a decade because of Donald Trump. We have an opportunity to turn the page and chart a new and joyful way forward where we tap into the ambitions. And we will tap into the ambitions and the aspirations and the dreams of the American people. And let me tell you something. As I travel our country, there is an overwhelming call for a fresh start. People from all walks of life, and they are calling for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic and excited about what we can do together. There is a yearning in our country for a president who will see you, who gets you, and who will fight for you. And listen, hey, on the subject of Gaza, hey guys, I hear you, on the subject of Gaza, we all want this war to end as soon as possible and get the hostages out, and I will do everything in my power to make it so. And let's be clear, we are all here because we are fighting for a democracy and for the right of people to be heard and seen. And we're not about the enemy within. We know we are all in this together. That's what we are fighting for. And my whole career. Ha-la-la, ha-la-la, ha-la-la, ha-la-la, ha-la-la, ha-la-la, ha-la-la, ha-la-la, ha-la-la, ha-la-la, ha-la-la, ha-la-la, ha-la-la, ha-la-la. Okay, now I want each of you to shout your own name. Do that. Because it's about all of us. It's about all of us. And listen, I have fought my whole career to put the people first and to put the people above partisanship. I never once asked in my career, are you a Democrat or are you a Republican? The only thing I ever asked is how can I help you? Are you okay? And that, and that is a major difference between Donald Trump and me. And between the two extremely different visions that he and I have for our nation. His is focused on himself and the past. Ours is focused on the future and it is focused on the people. So together we will build a future where we bring down the cost of living. That will be my focus every single day as president. Because while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still too high. You know it and I know it. And unlike Donald Trump, who had $400 million handed to him on a silver platter, and don't forget he filed for bankruptcy six times the great businessman. Unlike him, I grew up in a middle class neighborhood with a working mother who kept a strict budget and did everything she could to make sure that my sister and I had all we needed. I come from the middle class and I will never forget where I come from. And so my common sense plan will lower the prices you pay on everything from prescription medication to groceries to housing. On the other hand, Donald Trump will raise costs on you and your family. In fact, independent economists have analyzed both of our plans and found mine will cut your cost and strengthen our economy while his will increase inflation and lead to a recession by the middle of next year. And his agenda is laid out in project 2025. You know I say everywhere. And I know we've got a lot of students here and I have to tell you, I just find it really interesting that they put that thing in writing. They put it in writing. They bound it. They published it. They handed it out. And then they expect we're not going to talk about it. Are you kidding me? And when you read it, you will see it is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he plans to do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will impose a 20% national sales tax on everyday basic necessities which economists have estimated will cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year. Contrast. On the other hand, I'm going to take on corporate price gouging. I've done it before and I will do it again. Donald Trump will give massive tax cuts like he did before to billionaires and the biggest corporations. He did it the last time. He's going to do it again. I on the other hand will give middle class tax cuts to 100 million Americans including $6,000 for the first year of a child's life because I understand how that will lift America's children out of poverty which must be one of our highest goals. Donald Trump will get rid of the $35 a month cap on insulin for our seniors. He will cut Medicare and Social Security. In fact, economists say he will bankrupt Social Security in the next six years. And understand what that means. So many of the seniors in America, that's their only source of income. That's the only way they're able to pay their rent and buy food. I have a plan to support our seniors so they can grow older with dignity and so their families are not overwhelmed by the cost of home health care. On top of that, my plan will bring down the cost of housing. Cut taxes for small businesses because small businesses are the backbone of our economy. And lower health care costs because I believe health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. Donald Trump, on the other hand, intends to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back, which would take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. Do you remember what that was like? Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. And we're not going back because we together will move forward to the future because we believe in who we are and what is possible and because we know it is time to turn the page. It is time to turn the page. Ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we all remember how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did as he intended and now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exceptions, even for rapinence, as I was just in Texas the other day, you know they provide prison for life for doctors and nurses and health care providers for providing care, prison for life. And no exceptions for a crime that is a violation of someone's body and then to tell that survivor of that violation you have no right to make a decision about what happens to your body next. That is immoral. It is immoral. And I know we all agree. One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that the government should not be telling her what to do. Not the government. And listen, you all have heard me say, I do believe Donald Trump to be an unserious man, but the consequences of him ever being president again are brutally serious. Consider on the topic we were just discussing, Donald Trump still refuses to acknowledge the pain and suffering he has caused. He insists that quote, everyone wanted for Roe v. Wade to be overturned. Everyone wanted this? Women are being denied care during miscarriages. Some only being treated when they've developed sepsis. They didn't want this. Couples trying to grow their family have been cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. They didn't want this. The men of America are seeing their daughters and wives and sisters and mothers put at risk because their rights have been taken from them. The men of America don't want this. And women have died because of these bans. How could anyone say these folks wanted this? And I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. Proudly. And I'm traveling our nations. I have to tell everyone here, across our nation, we are seeing a full-on assault on other and additional hard fought, hard won freedoms and rights. Like the freedom to vote. I was just in Georgia. You know they passed a law that makes it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote? The hypocrisy abounds. Whatever happened to love thy neighbor, right? Attacks on the freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. So I say to everyone here what you know. Generations of Americans before us fought for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands. The baton is in our hands. And I want to speak specifically to all the young leaders, all the students who are here today. I want to speak to you for a moment. So I love your generation. I really do. And one of the things about it is you are rightly impatient for change. I love that about you. You are impatient for change. Because look, you have only known the climate crisis and are leading then the charge to protect our planet and our future. You, you young leaders who grew up with active shooter drills and are fighting then to keep our schools safe. You, who now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers are standing up for reproductive freedom. And for you, and for you then, I know that these issues that are at stake, they are not theoretical. This is not political for you. It is your lived experience. And I see you. And I see your power. And I know many of you are voting for the first time. Can I see a raise of hands who's voting for the first time? Can we hear it for our first time voters? See, that's why I know the future of our country is bright. That's why I know. So listen, so much is on the line in this election. And this is not 2016 or 2020. We can all see that Donald Trump is even more unstable. And more unhinged. And now he wants unchecked power. And this time, and this time, there will be no one there to stop him. Not even the Supreme Court, which months ago told the former president that he is essentially immune no matter what he would do in the White House. So think about it. Before, at least there was the threat, the possibility that there would be some accountability and consequence. Now the Supreme Court has said he is effectively would be immune. So just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. He who has vowed he would be a dictator on day one. He who has even called for quote the termination of the Constitution of the United States of America. And let us be clear. Anyone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States of America. Never again. Never again. Never again. So, Michigan, there is a huge contrast in this election. And I'd ask us to just imagine the Oval Office in three months. Okay. So just picture it in your head. So either it's Donald Trump sitting in there, stewing, stewing over his enemies list, or me with your help working for you checking off my to-do list. So Michigan, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we know what is at stake. Everyone here out of your busy lives, the time you have taken to be here tonight. And to be here because we know not only what is at stake, but we are here together because we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. And you know when you love something, you got to fight for it. Ours is not a fight against something. Ours is not a fight against something. It is a fight for something. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism. Love of our country to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what our campaign is about. That's what we are about. And one of the most powerful ways that we will do that is with our vote. So now is the time to get out the vote, Michigan. Now is the time. And we have eight days to get this done. So obviously nobody here is going to sit on the sidelines and let's make sure that we spend the next eight days knowing that in nine days when we look back, we will be able to say and know we did everything we could to realize the promise of America. And remind our friends and our classmates and our neighbors and our coworkers that we're all in this together. You know there's been something about this Trump era that has been very backward in terms of trying to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. Instead of what we all know, the true measure of our individual and collective strength is based on who we lift up. That's what we are about. And over these next eight days, yes we will win, yes we must win, but let's also approach these eight days knowing our power to build community, knowing our power to build coalitions, knowing our power to reach out to one another, reminding us that nobody is alone, that we are all in this together. And let's do that then while we knock on doors, while we take the time to text and call potential voters, let's reach out to our family and our friends and our classmates and our neighbors and make sure they know the stakes in this election and let's remind them your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. And so, Michigan, I then ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.",full,2950

So let me just say about Tim Walls, he's been such an extraordinary running mate, and he will be an extraordinary vice president of the United States. And let me tell you why I love Coach Walls. As he travels to every corner of our country, meeting with people in small towns, big towns, everywhere in between, Coach Walls is always bringing the joy. He is always bringing the joy. He cares about people, he understands people, he understands hard work, and he understands what it means to be a leader who lifts people up instead of trying to beat people down. That is Tim Walls.

2024-10-29,Rally,Kamala Harris full Ellipse Speech in Washington D.C.,full,"Good evening, everyone. Good evening. And thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. So listen, one week from today, you will have the chance to make a decision that directly impacts your life, the life of your family, and the future of this country we love. And it will probably be the most important vote you ever cast. And this election is more than just a choice between two parties and two different candidates. It is a choice about whether we have a country rooted in freedom for every American or ruled by chaos and division. Many of you watching have probably already cast your ballots. But I know many others are still considering who to vote for or whether you'll vote at all. So tonight, I will speak to everyone about the choice and the stakes in this election. Look, we know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election. An election that he knew he lost. Americans died as a result of that attack. 140 law enforcement officers were injured because of that attack. And while Donald Trump sat in the White House watching as the violence unfolded on television, he was told by his staff that the mob wanted to kill his own vice president. And Donald Trump responded with two words. So what? America, that's who Donald Trump is. And that's who is asking you to give him another four years in the Oval Office. Not to focus on your problems, but to focus on his. And Donald Trump has told us his priorities for a second term. He has an enemy's list of people he intends to prosecute. He says that one of his highest priorities is to set free the violent extremists who insulted those law enforcement officers on January 6th. Donald Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him. People, he calls quote, the enemy from within. America, this is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other. That is who he is. But America, I am here tonight to say that is not who we are. That is not who we are. You see, what Donald Trump has never understood is that e pluribus unum out of many one isn't just a phrase on a dollar bill. It is a living truth about the heart of our nation, our democracy, doesn't require us to agree on everything. In fact, we like good arguments from time to time. Just think of your own family, right? It is not the American way to not have disagreements. We don't shy away from robust debate. We like a good debate, don't we? We like a good debate. And the fact that someone disagrees with us does not make them the enemy within. They are family, neighbors, classmates, coworkers. They are fellow Americans. And as Americans, we rise and fall together. America, for too long we have been consumed with too much division, chaos, and mutual distrust. And it can be easy then to forget a simple truth. It doesn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be this way. It is time to stop pointing fingers. We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms. It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the fear, and division. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next President of the United States of America. Now look, let me say, let me say, I recognize this has not been a typical campaign. Even though I have had the honor of serving as your Vice President for the last four years, I know, but I know that many of you are still getting to know who I am. Well, let me tell you, I am someone who has spent most of my career outside of Washington, D.C. So I know that not all the good ideas come from here. I am not afraid of tough fights against bad actors and powerful interests. Because for decades, as a prosecutor and a top law enforcement officer of our biggest state, I won fights against big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children, and cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings. And I did this work because for as long as I can remember, I have always had an instinct to protect. There's something about people being treated unfairly or overlooked that frankly just gets to me. I don't like it. It's what my mother instilled in me. A drive to hold accountable those who use their wealth or power to take advantage of other people. The drive to protect hard-working Americans who aren't always seen or heard and deserve a voice. And I will tell you that is the kind of president I will be. And look, I'll be honest with you, I'm not perfect. I make mistakes. But here's what I promise you. I will always listen to you. Even if you don't vote for me, I will always tell you the truth. Even if it is difficult to hear, I will work every day to build consensus and reach compromise to get things done. And if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. So look, in less than 90 days, either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office. On day one, on day one, and on day one, if elected, on day one if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemy's list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list full of priorities of what I will get done for the American people. And I will work with everyone, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, to help Americans who are working hard and still struggling to get ahead. I have been honored to serve as Joe Biden's Vice President. But I will bring my own experiences and ideas to the Oval Office. My presidency will be different because the challenges we face are different. Our top priority as a nation four years ago was to end the pandemic and rescue the economy. Now, our biggest challenge is to lower costs, costs that were rising even before the pandemic, and that are still too high. I get it. I still remember our mother sitting at that yellow Formica table late at night, cup of tea in hand, a pile of bills in front of her, trying to make it all work. And I've heard from so many of you who are facing even greater financial pressures. Donald Trump's answer to you is the same as it was the last time. Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations. And this time, he will pay for it with a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Think about it. Clothes, food, toys, cell phones, a Trump sales tax that would cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year. And on top of that, you will pay even more if Donald Trump finally gets his way and repeals the Affordable Care Act. Which would throw millions of Americans off their health insurance and take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. Because we also know Donald Trump would deliver tax cuts to his billionaire donors. I will deliver tax cuts to working people and the middle class. I will make sure you have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead. Because I believe in honoring the dignity of work. I will enact the first ever federal ban on price gouging on groceries. Cap the price of insulin and limit out-of-pocket prescription costs for all Americans. I will fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. I will never forget how our mother saved up and how excited she was when she could finally afford to buy our first home. I remember how excited she was. And I know that owning a home is not only a measure of financial security. It is about the pride of your hard work. As president, I will fight to help first-time home buyers with your down payment, take on the companies that are jacking up rents and build millions of new homes. There's, we have heard excuses about why America can't build enough housing. Enough with the excuses, I'm going to cut the red tape and work with the private sector and local governments to speed up building and get it done. And the cost of housing isn't the only financial pressure on middle-class families. I have met so many young people who have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources to do it. So I'll fight for a child tax credit to save them some money, which will also lift American children out of poverty. Our work to lower the cost of childcare, which is out of reach for too many working families today, and for too many people in the sandwich generation who are raising young children and taking care of a parent, juggling all of it is extremely difficult. You know, I took care of my mother when she got sick, cooking foes, food that she had a taste for, finding clothes that would not irritate her skin, and understand, as I do, that caregiving is about dignity. It is about dignity. And currently, if you need home care and you don't have some money to hire someone, you and your family need to deplete your savings to qualify for help. That's just not right. So we're going to change the approach and allow Medicare to cover the cost of home care so seniors can get the help and care they need in their own homes. Now, Donald Trump has a different approach. He tried to cut Medicare and Social Security every year he was president. Look, I believe that when people have worked hard their entire life, they deserve to retire with the benefits they have earned. And I believe in the fundamental freedom of Americans to make decisions about their own bodies and not have their government tell them what to do. I will fight to restore what Donald Trump and his hand-selected Supreme Court justices took away from the women of America. That today, one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. The idea that a woman who survives a crime of a violation to her body should not have the authority to make a decision about what happens to her body next, that is immoral. That is immoral. And Trump's not done. He would ban abortion nationwide, restrict access to birth control and put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. Just Google Project 2025 and read the plans for yourself. And look, I think we all know one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to simply agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. Not the government. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. And look, on another subject, politicians have got to stop treating immigration as an issue to scare up votes in an election. And instead treat it as the serious challenge that it is that we must finally come together to solve. I will work with Democrats and Republicans to sign into law the border security bill that Donald Trump killed. When I was Attorney General of a border state, I saw the chaos and violence caused by transnational criminal organizations that I took on. And when I am President, we will quickly remove those who arrive here unlawfully, prosecute the cartels, and give Border Patrol the support they so desperately need. At the same time, we must acknowledge we are a nation of immigrants. And I will work with Congress to pass immigration reform, including an earned path to citizenship for hardworking immigrants like farm workers and our dreamers. As Commander-in-Chief, I will make sure America has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. Donald Trump, on the other hand, has shown his contempt for our nation's heroes, calls them suckers and losers, called a four-star Marine General a quote, low life. I will always honor, never denigrate, the service and sacrifice of our troops and their families, and fulfill our sacred obligation to care for them. I will strengthen, not surrender, America's global leadership. And I will stand with our friends because I know that our alliances keep American people safe and make America stronger and more secure. Look, world leaders think that Donald Trump is an easy mark, easy to manipulate with flattery or favor. And you can believe that autocrats like Putin and Kim Jong-un are rooting for him in this election. I will always uphold our security, advance our national interests, and ensure that the United States of America remains as we must forever be a champion of liberty around the world. America, we know what Donald Trump has in mind. More chaos, more division, and policies that help those at the very top and hurt everyone else. I offer a different path, and I ask for your vote. And here is my pledge to you. I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to make your life better. I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to listen, to experts, to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, and to people who disagree with me. Unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. I pledge to you to approach my work with the joy and optimism that comes from making a difference in people's lives. And I pledge to be a president for all Americans. And to always put country above party and self. I love our country with all my heart. And I believe in its promise because I've lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches in a stroller where crowds of people of all races, faiths, and walks of life came together to fight for the ideals of freedom and opportunity. I've lived the promise of America. I saw how hard our mother worked to give her daughters the same chances this country gave her. Growing up, I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love, who instilled in me the values of community, compassion, and faith that have always defined our nation at its best. I've lived the promise of America. I've spent my life fighting for the people who have been hurt and counted out, but never stopped believing that in our country anything is possible. I've lived the promise of America. And I see the promise of America in all of you. In all of you. I see it. I see it in the young people who are voting for the first time, who are determined to live free from gun violence and to protect our planet and to shape the world they inherit. I see it in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. And the men who support them. I see it in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before, but have put the Constitution of the United States over party. I've seen it in Americans different in many respects, but united in our pursuit of freedom, our belief in fairness and decency, and our faith in a better future. America, I know the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. I know it. And that's why I am in this race, to fight for the people just like I always have. Yeah. Nearly 250 years ago, America was born when we rested freedom from a petty tyrant. Across the generations, Americans have preserved that freedom, expanded it, and in so doing, proved to the world that a government of, by, and for the people is strong and can endure. And those who came before us, the patriots at Normandy and Selma, Seneca Falls and Stonewall, on farmlands and factory floors, they did not struggle, sacrifice, and lay down their lives only to see us cede our fundamental freedoms. They didn't do that, only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant. These United States of America, we are not a vessel for the schemes of wannabe dictators. The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised. A nation big enough to encompass all our dreams, strong enough to withstand any fracture or fissure between us, and fearless enough to imagine a future of possibilities. So America, let us reach for that future. Let us fight for this beautiful country we love. And in seven days, we have the power, each of you has the power to turn the page and start writing the next chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told. I thank you all. God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",full,3080
2024-10-29,Rally,Kamala Harris full Ellipse Speech in Washington D.C.,chunk,"Good evening, everyone. Good evening. And thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. So listen, one week from today, you will have the chance to make a decision that directly impacts your life, the life of your family, and the future of this country we love. And it will probably be the most important vote you ever cast. And this election is more than just a choice between two parties and two different candidates. It is a choice about whether we have a country rooted in freedom for every American or ruled by chaos and division. Many of you watching have probably already cast your ballots. But I know many others are still considering who to vote for or whether you'll vote at all. So tonight, I will speak to everyone about the choice and the stakes in this election. Look, we know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election. An election that he knew he lost. Americans died as a result of that attack. 140 law enforcement officers were injured because of that attack. And while Donald Trump sat in the White House watching as the violence unfolded on television, he was told by his staff that the mob wanted to kill his own vice president. And Donald Trump responded with two words. So what? America, that's who Donald Trump is. And that's who is asking you to give him another four years in the Oval Office. Not to focus on your problems, but to focus on his. And Donald Trump has told us his priorities for a second term. He has an enemy's list of people he intends to prosecute. He says that one of his highest priorities is to set free the violent extremists who insulted those law enforcement officers on January 6th. Donald Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him. People, he calls quote, the enemy from within. America, this is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better.",chunk_1,386
2024-10-29,Rally,Kamala Harris full Ellipse Speech in Washington D.C.,chunk,"This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other. That is who he is. But America, I am here tonight to say that is not who we are. That is not who we are. You see, what Donald Trump has never understood is that e pluribus unum out of many one isn't just a phrase on a dollar bill. It is a living truth about the heart of our nation, our democracy, doesn't require us to agree on everything. In fact, we like good arguments from time to time. Just think of your own family, right? It is not the American way to not have disagreements. We don't shy away from robust debate. We like a good debate, don't we? We like a good debate.

Are we ready to win? Oh, it's good to be back in Madison. It's good to be back. And many of you may know when I was five years old, my parents taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. And so for a time, my sister Maya and I lived not far from here in a house on Lake Mendota. So it's good to be back and it is good to be with so many incredible leaders. And I first of all want to thank everybody who is here right now for taking the time you have taken to be here. I also want to thank our Governor of Wisconsin, Evers. Governor Evers. Thank you always. Every time I land, he says welcome home. Senator Baldwin, a champion for working families. Representative Pocan, Mayor Rhodes Conway, Mandela Barnes, and can we hear it for our amazing musicians, Gracie Abrams, Grammy Wolves, The National, and Monkford & Sons. All right, so Madison, early voting has started. Here in Madison, you can vote early now through Sunday, November 3rd. And we need you to vote early, Wisconsin, because we have six days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we have work to do. But we like hard work. Hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We will win. Yes, we will win. We will win. We will win. And I will tell you, we will win.

So, Madison, we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. That is who he is, but Madison, that is not who we are. And folks are exhausted and want it to stop the pointing fingers. It is time that we start locking arms together as a people who rise and fall together. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next President of the United States. And Wisconsin, you know me. I am not afraid of tough fights.

I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children, against cartels that trafficked in guns and drugs and human beings. And Wisconsin, if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as President, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way of fighting for you. And here's the thing. And here's the thing. We know who Donald Trump is. This is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, it's either going to be him or me in the Oval Office. And here's what you know, and here's what we know. If he is elected, it's not going to happen, but if he were elected, on day one Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemy's list. You know, he talks about the enemies from within. When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list focused on your needs. And at the top of my list is bringing down your cost of living. That will be my focus every single day as President. I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. We will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. We would like to make sure hard-working Americans can actually afford a place to live. And if any of you out there are caring for an elderly parent, well, my plan will cover the cost of home care under Medicare so that seniors can get the help and care they need to stay in their own homes. It's about dignity. It's about dignity. And my plan will lower the cost of childcare, cut taxes for small businesses. Do we have any small business owners here? I love our small businesses. My plan will lower healthcare costs because, by the way, I believe access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. It's about values. It's about values. On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face, well, it's the same as it was last time. Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations. And this time he will pay for it with a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Clothes, food, toys, cell phones. A Trump sales tax would cost the average American family nearly $4,000 more a year. And on top of that, you would pay even more if Donald Trump finally gets his way and gets rid of the Affordable Care Act. Remember how many times he's tried to do that? And you're booing because if he were successful, it would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like? Well, we are not going back. We're not going back. Just like Wisconsin State motto tells us we will move forward. Because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. Freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we all remember how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended. And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And look, Donald Trump's not done. He would ban abortion nationwide. Yes, even here in Wisconsin. And he would restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk and forced states, listen to this, forced states to monitor women's pregnancies. Just Google project 2025. Read the plans yourself. And I know we all here know one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree. The government shouldn't be telling her what to do with her body. Not the government. Not the government. Not the government. And when Congress, together with Tammy's help, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. So Wisconsin, I am asking for your vote. And here is my pledge to you. As president, I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. And I pledge. Because I know we can. Because I know we can. I know we can make progress. And I pledge then to listen to experts, to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, and to people who disagree with me. Because look, unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at my table. And I pledge to always put country above party and self, and to be a president for all Americans. So it all comes down to this. We are here together for many reasons, but one of the most important. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. You can say it. And I do believe that one of the highest forms of patriotism of our expression for the love of our country is to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights movement. My parents would take me to the marches when I was in a stroller, where people from every walk of life came together to fight for freedom and for opportunity. Growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chances our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love, who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith. I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt or who have been counted out, but who never stop believing that in our country anything is possible. I have lived the promise of America. And today I see the promise of America in all of you, in all of you. In every one year, I see it in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. And the men who support them. I see it in the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future. I see it in Republicans who never voted for a Democrat before, but put the Constitution of the United States over party. And every day I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. And I love your generation. I just love you guys. Let me tell you why. One of the reasons is you all are rightly impatient for change. You who have only known the climate crisis are leading the charge to protect our planet and our future. You who grew up with active shooter drills are fighting to keep our schools safe. You who now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers are standing up for freedom. And what I know about you is these issues are not theoretical. This is not political for you. This is your lived experience. And I see you. And I see your power. I see your power. And I am so proud of you. Can we hear it for our first time voters? So was I. Okay, we got six days to get this thing done. No one can sit on the sidelines. So let's spend the next six days so that when we look backward after the sixth day, we will know we did everything we could. Okay? So now is the time to knock on doors, to text, to call, to reach out to family and friends and classmates and coworkers and neighbors. And as we do, here's my request. As we do all of that, let's be intentional about building community. And let's be intentional about building coalitions. Let's remember that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And let's approach this. Let's approach this with that spirit. And with the spirit of in the face of a stranger seeing a neighbor. Let's do it that way. Okay? Let's do it that way. And let us remember that your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. So Madison, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.",full,2069

Representative Pocan, Mayor Rhodes Conway, Mandela Barnes, and can we hear it for our amazing musicians, Gracie Abrams, Grammy Wolves, The National, and Monkford & Sons. All right, so Madison, early voting has started. Here in Madison, you can vote early now through Sunday, November 3rd.

Listen, we all want the war in Gaza to end and get the hostages out as soon as possible. And I will do everything in my power to make it heard and known. And everyone has a right to be heard, but right now I am speaking. So, Madison, we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other.

On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to financial pressures is for you to face the same deal. Here's the thing. Let me say something. We are six days out of an election. We are six days away from an election. And ours is about a fight for democracy and your right to be heard. That is what is on the line in this election. That is what is on the line in this election. Look, everybody has a right to be heard, but right now I am speaking. And one of the biggest issues that folks around the country want to talk about and hear is about how we are going to bring down the price of living for working people. And people know that Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures that you face is the same as the last time another trillion dollar tax cut for billionaires and big corporations. And this time he will pay for it with a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Clothes, food, toys, cell phones. And a Trump sales tax would cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year. These are some of the issues that are on the line in the next six days. And that's why we are here saying we will not stand for it. We stand for working people. We stand for middle class growth and strength. We are here together because we know what's on the line. We know that Donald Trump will try like he has so many times to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which would throw millions of Americans off of their health care and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was? Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump, when he was president, hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would do just as they did and overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. Now in America, one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral. Immoral. And look, Donald Trump's not done. He would ban abortion nationwide. Yes, even here in Pennsylvania, if he were successful. He would restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. Just Google Project 2025, read the plans for yourself. And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply help beliefs to agree. The government shouldn't be telling people what to do. Not the government. Not the government. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government or Donald Trump telling people what to do. And I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. So, Pennsylvania, I am asking for your vote. And here is my pledge to you. And here is my pledge to you. As your President, I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. Thank you. And let me say, look, I'll repeat, we are fighting for a democracy. We love our democracy. It could be complicated at times, but it is the best system in the world. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. All right. So look, I will continue with my point. I pledge to you that as President of the United States, I will not be looking to score political points. I will be looking to make progress. And I pledge to listen to experts, to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, and to the people who disagree with me. And at this particular moment, it should be emphasized that unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy from within. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. And I pledge to be a president for all Americans and to always put country above party and self. That's right. That's right. So Pennsylvania, look, it all comes down to this. We are all here together, and you have taken so much time out of your life to be here because we love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, an expression of our love of our country to then fight for its ideals, to fight for the ideals of our country, and to fight for the promise of America. That's what this is about. I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller, where people from all walks of life, all kinds of backgrounds, came together to fight for the ideals of our country, the ideals of freedom and opportunity. I've lived the promise of America. I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chances our country gave her. Growing up, growing up, I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love. Who instilled in me, like all of us, who instilled in me the values that have always defined our nation at its best, like the value of community. Of compassion and faith. I've lived the promise of America. I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out, but who never stop believing that in our country anything is possible. I've lived the promise of America, I've seen the promise of America in this beautiful assembly of people of you who understand what is at stake and also what we have yet to do. That's what this is about. This is about our joy and our optimism, about what has yet to be done that we can do together as one community of people who love their country. And I see then the promise of America, in for example the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. I see it in the men who support them. I see it in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before, but put the Constitution of the United States before parties. I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who I know are here right now voting for the first time. When they see your hands, right? And I love this generation of leaders because listen, you are rightly impatient for change. You who are determined to live free from gun violence, to tackle the climate crisis, and shake the world you inherit. For these young leaders, let me tell you, none of this is theoretical for them. It's not political for them. For the young leaders, this is their lived experience. And I see you and I see your power, and I am so proud of you. Let's hear it for our first time voters. I see you. So Pennsylvania, we have six days to get this done. No one can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next six days so when we look back, we will know that we've done everything we could. It's time to knock on doors, time to text and call voters, time to reach out to family and friends and neighbors and classmates and coworkers.

And I know plenty of folks are just exhausted with it all and know that it is time to stop pointing fingers and to start locking arms. It is time. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And together with you, we will do this, and I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. And let me just say, Pennsylvania, you know my background. I am not afraid of tough fights for decades as a prosecutor and the top law enforcement officer of our biggest state. I won fights against the big banks that were ripping off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children and cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings. And if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing that will stand in my way of working for you. And look, we know who Donald Trump is, right? So this is someone who is not thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. And look, in less than 90 days, either he or I will be in the Oval Office. What? Wait. OK. And it is. Because here's the thing, we know if he is elected, on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemy's list. When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. And at the top of my list is bringing down your cost of living. That will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle-class tax cut to 100 million Americans, enact the first ever federal ban on price gouging on groceries, and fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. If you are caring for an elderly parent, my plan will cover the cost of home care under Medicare. So seniors can get the help they need and the care they need to stay in their own homes. It's about dignity. It's about dignity, which is why my plan will also lower the cost of childcare.",chunk_2,393

On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to financial pressures is for you to face the same deal. Here's the thing. Let me say something. We are six days out of an election. We are six days away from an election. And ours is about a fight for democracy and your right to be heard. That is what is on the line in this election. That is what is on the line in this election. Look, everybody has a right to be heard, but right now I am speaking. And one of the biggest issues that folks around the country want to talk about and hear is about how we are going to bring down the price of living for working people. And people know that Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures that you face is the same as the last time another trillion dollar tax cut for billionaires and big corporations. And this time he will pay for it with a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Clothes, food, toys, cell phones. And a Trump sales tax would cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year. These are some of the issues that are on the line in the next six days. And that's why we are here saying we will not stand for it. We stand for working people. We stand for middle class growth and strength. We are here together because we know what's on the line. We know that Donald Trump will try like he has so many times to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which would throw millions of Americans off of their health care and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was? Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future.

2024-10-30,Rally,"Harris holds rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania",chunk,"And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump, when he was president, hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would do just as they did and overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. Now in America, one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral. Immoral. And look, Donald Trump's not done. He would ban abortion nationwide. Yes, even here in Pennsylvania, if he were successful. He would restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. Just Google Project 2025, read the plans for yourself. And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply help beliefs to agree. The government shouldn't be telling people what to do. Not the government. Not the government. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government or Donald Trump telling people what to do. And I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. So, Pennsylvania, I am asking for your vote. And here is my pledge to you. And here is my pledge to you. As your President, I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. Thank you. And let me say, look, I'll repeat, we are fighting for a democracy. We love our democracy. It could be complicated at times, but it is the best system in the world. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. All right. So look, I will continue with my point. I pledge to you that as President of the United States, I will not be looking to score political points. I will be looking to make progress. And I pledge to listen to experts, to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, and to the people who disagree with me.

We are all here together, and you have taken so much time out of your life to be here because we love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, an expression of our love of our country to then fight for its ideals, to fight for the ideals of our country, and to fight for the promise of America. That's what this is about. I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller, where people from all walks of life, all kinds of backgrounds, came together to fight for the ideals of our country, the ideals of freedom and opportunity. I've lived the promise of America. I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chances our country gave her. Growing up, growing up, I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love. Who instilled in me, like all of us, who instilled in me the values that have always defined our nation at its best, like the value of community. Of compassion and faith. I've lived the promise of America. I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out, but who never stop believing that in our country anything is possible. I've lived the promise of America, I've seen the promise of America in this beautiful assembly of people of you who understand what is at stake and also what we have yet to do. That's what this is about. This is about our joy and our optimism, about what has yet to be done that we can do together as one community of people who love their country.

And I love this generation of leaders because listen, you are rightly impatient for change. You who are determined to live free from gun violence, to tackle the climate crisis, and shake the world you inherit. For these young leaders, let me tell you, none of this is theoretical for them. It's not political for them. For the young leaders, this is their lived experience. And I see you and I see your power, and I am so proud of you. Let's hear it for our first time voters. I see you.

2024-10-30,Rally,"Kamala Harris hosts campaign rally in Raleigh, N.C",full,"Another question, who here, like me, loves North Carolina? North Carolina is home. Home to remarkable natural beauty from the beaches to the mountain and everywhere in between. Home to a growing economy. But most importantly, home to exceptional people. Students who look out for each other, who step up in times of crisis, who rebuild and renew, who believe in brighter days and a stronger North Carolina. I'm running for governor because I love our home state. And I believe in its promise that if you work hard, where you come from should never limit how far you can go. To deliver on that promise, we must invest in our people and their futures so that together we build a safer, stronger North Carolina where the economy continues to grow and works for more people. Where our public schools are excellent and our teachers are well-paid, where our neighborhoods are safe and our personal freedoms are protected. And I want to underline one point. As your next governor, I will veto any further restrictions on women's reproductive freedom. Governing is not complicated. Put the people first and then fight for them. That's the job of Attorney General. When Kamala Harris was Attorney General of California, she prosecuted transnational drug organizations keeping her people safe. She took on big banks and delivered billions of dollars in relief to struggling homeowners. I got to work with her on the national mortgage settlement and I saw firsthand how she was committed to stopping Wall Street from abusing your street. As your Attorney General, I've been fighting for the people of our state and delivering. Whether it's eliminating what had been the largest backlog of untested rape kits in this entire nation, or securing the largest price gouging settlement in state history, or defending Obamacare successfully in the United States Supreme Court, or defending a woman's right to choose, or defending everyone's right to vote. Friends, those freedoms and so much more are on the line this November. The stakes could not be higher and the choice could not be clear. Two competing visions, our vision, Kamala Harris' vision, is positive, forward-looking, welcoming. It is about fighting for every person, creating opportunity for every person, tapping the potential of every person so that together we build a better, brighter future for all of us. Donald Trump and Mark Robinson's vision is one of division, violence, and hate. Mark Robinson called public school teachers wicked, gay people filth. He disrespect women saying that they only have abortions because they can't keep their skirts down. Saying that women are not called to lead. Are there any women here who are called to lead? His vice president, Harris, called to lead. This summer, from a church pulpit of all places, he yelled, some folks need killing. But it's not just what he says, it's what he would do. Slash public school funding firing 13,000 educators, eliminating early voting and completely banning abortion in North Carolina without any exceptions. He denies that Joe Biden won the 2020 election. He denies the climate crisis that has devastated Western North Carolina. He denies the Holocaust. Friends, we must deny him the governorship of North Carolina. Because we want to build a better future. We choose hope over hate. We choose competence over chaos. We choose decency over division. Look, when North Carolinians come together, we do amazing things. Working together across the aisle under Governor Cooper's leadership, last year we expanded Medicaid in North Carolina. We have cracked down on the deadly scourge of Fendall. We have created good-paying jobs. To keep that path of progress, we must win races up and down the ballot. Folks, elections in North Carolina are always close, but that means that we have power. The power to determine who wins and who loses. And because the path to the presidency runs right through North Carolina, we have the power to shape the future not only of our home state, but this nation and the world. To possess that power is a privilege and a responsibility. We have six days left to use our power, to knock on doors, to post on social media, to talk to friends, family, and neighbors. Who here has already voted? Now it is time to get to work on your friends, your family, to make sure that they too have a plan to vote. Victory is right in front of us. We just have to seize it. Do you all want to win? Will you do the work? As the vice president tells us, when we work, we win. When we work, when we vote, and when we win, we will break the supermajority of the General Assembly. We will defeat Mark Robinson, and we will put Kamala Harris and Tim Walsh into the White House. So let's get to work, let's vote, and let's win. Thank you and God bless you all. Please welcome Governor Roy Cooper. Hello, Raleigh. Boy, do we ever need to elect Josh Stein as our next governor. It is great to be with so many friends today. I see so many familiar faces. Thank you for caring about the future of our state and country, and for showing up to do the work to elect the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. Let's just take just a minute. I know we're still holding our Western North Carolina friends close to our hearts. Helene was the most devastating storm in our state's history, but our work on response and recovery continues every day, and I know that all of North Carolina will be with our brothers and sisters out west for the long haul. So thank you for that. But you know, even Mother Nature doesn't stop this election from marching onward. And out on the campaign trail, Vice President Harris is showing us every single day how we can turn the page on Donald Trump and chart a new way forward. You know, I want a president who wakes up every morning thinking about the American people, not a president who wakes up every morning thinking about himself. You know, Donald Trump is too focused on his own power and his own revenge to care about your life, your cost of living, your freedoms, your futures. But Kamala Harris cares about you. You know, she wants to help you with her to-do list, unlike Donald Trump, who keeps an enemy's list. She wants to help the middle class while Donald Trump wants to help his billionaire buddies. Now look, I have been friends with Kamala for almost 15 years. I know her well. Back when we were state attorneys general together. And ever since I've known her, Kamala Harris has been fighting and winning for everyday people. When the big banks were ripping off homeowners, she took them on. When the drug cartels were poisoning our streets, she stood up to them and worked to put them in jail. She gets the job done for people who need her. And that's good because we have a lot of challenges facing us over the next four years. But I'll tell you what, we have one hell of a fighter ready to take them on. I know that because I know her. Now, there are some people out there, and I'm going to depend on everybody here to help us with this, but there are some people who are still deciding who to vote for. People who love our country and respect our constitution, and they don't like things about both candidates. I would ask those people, and this is something you could propose to them, to listen to the ultra-conservative, well-respected leaders who worked with Donald Trump when he was last president, his chief of staff, his military generals, his attorney general, his vice president. They know Donald Trump is a danger to our constitution and to our democracy and should never be president again. And I'll tell you this, even if you don't agree with her on everything, you can always count on Kamala Harris to fight for you to the very end. For families who need better healthcare and affordable place to live, Kamala will fight for you. For parents who want better schools for their kids, for workers worried about a secure retirement for themselves, Kamala will fight for you. For people who believe we must protect women's reproductive freedom, Kamala will fight for you. And for our allies anywhere in the world wondering if America still has your back, remember this, Kamala will fight for you. And when she fights, we win. I know this, and she's coming in back there in just a minute. I'll talk to her. Kamala's ready. The question is, are we going to stand up and fight for Kamala like she'll stand up and fight for us? Six days left, guys. Six days left. Are we knocking on doors? Are we making phone calls? Are we talking with our neighbors and friends? Are we going to make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States? You bet we are. Let's go get him, North Carolina. Let's go get him. Okay, I see you know that.

The flaw in the plan was that he was a failed businessman who really only cares about one thing, not himself, and his business acumen is pretty much limited to filing bankruptcy and bullying people in court. That's right. There was that plan. Then to add insult to injury, when Trump was in office, his extremism systematically destroyed the Republican Party, in my opinion. That's right. That's right. Now, today, as if it couldn't get any worse, we have Trump 2024, who is increasingly unhinged, unstable, and his quest to fulfill his promise to become a dictator on day one. We have him. He's even boldly talking about using the military against fellow Americans. He calls us the enemy from within. If he returns to office now that he has basically either kicked out or people have, yes, that's true, chosen to retire from public service, all the people that were principled, the adults in the room, if he were to get back into office, there would be no guardrails. We know what that would look like. There would be nothing to stop him from enacting that extreme Project 2025. There is hope. There is hope, and you all know what that hope is. A champion has emerged, and that is Vice President Harris. She's shown us. She's going to be a president that brings us together, someone who has a to-do list, not an enemy's list. She's also uniquely qualified to advocate for us, for all Americans, Kamala for the people. She's the ones that's going to fight for our freedoms, including especially the ability for women to control their own bodies. This is obviously something personal to all women and men in the fact that women's reproductive care is a very serious issue. To me, it's particularly personal. I have struggled with infertility and had my journey over the past 10 years. I have navigated dozens of IVF procedures, surgeries, setbacks, failures, things that politicians in DC and people authoring Project 2025 could never understand. In that process, I invested not just a lot of time and a good portion of my savings, but also a lot of emotional hope streams. In this process, I saw how legislative rules could really impact things unknowingly like IVF and the availability of IVF. When Trump brags, he likes to brag that he is proudly the person responsible for a returning row and unleashing extreme abortion bans across the country. If he is the father of IVF and he is not, I know this because I would have seen him in some of those dozen surgeries. If he would understand that this capricious allowing of Magna Republicans to insert themselves into these laws is absolutely going to jeopardize not just more lives and increase maternal mortality rates, it could prevent us, Greg and I, from starting the family that we desperately want to have. This is terrifying to me and I'm counting on you, North Carolina, to help make sure this does not happen. We know there is a clear choice in this election. It's obvious even to those people that still may identify as conservatives, if you believe in policy of any kind, you've got to be for Vice President Harris because the other guy doesn't have policy. But she's fighting. She's fighting for a new way forward and it's going to bring us back together. She's going to fight for our freedoms, protect our democracy, grow our economy and ensure everyone has the chance to succeed. Early voting is going on right now and if you haven't early voted, shame on you but the polls are open until 7.30. But I would challenge you. That's right, you have until Saturday but do it today. Why not? But I would call on especially my former conservative friends, it's time to be proud of this choice. So make sure to tell people, I'm for color. Alright so she's right back there and she can hear you. So let's give a, let's show her we're going to be the state, the swing state that puts her over the top. I am so honored and privileged to have the opportunity to introduce her and now the next, your next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Are we ready to vote? Are we ready to win? Oh it's good to be back in North Carolina. Thank you all and all the incredible leaders who are here. Thank you all, everyone for taking time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. I thank you. Thank you. And I want to thank my dear friend Governor Cooper, Roy Cooper, Attorney General Joss Stein, who will be your next governor, representatives, Nicole Ross-Bushy, and Mayor Baldwin. I thank you all and all the leaders who are here. So Raleigh, early voting as Jennifer said has started. Here in Wake County you can vote early now through Saturday, November 2nd. And we need you to vote early North Carolina. Because we have just six days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And we have work to do. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. Yes we will. And we will win. We will win. Because when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. And we know we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump who has been trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We know that is who he is, but North Carolina, that is not who we are. That is not who we are. And it is time for a new chapter where we stop with the pointing fingers at each other. And instead let us lock arms with one another knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready with you. I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. And North Carolina, you know I have been here many, many times over the years, and you know this, I am not afraid of tough fights. For decades as a prosecutor and as the top law enforcement officer of our biggest state, I won fights against big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children, against cartels that trafficked in guns and drugs and human beings. And if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. And look, we know who Donald Trump is. This is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. In less than 90 days, either he or I will be in the Oval Office. Thank you. Thank you. And here is the thing. There are many big differences between he and I, but I would say a major contrast is this. If he is elected on day one, Donald Trump will walk into that office with an enemy's list. When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list full of priorities about what I will get done for you, the American people. And at the top of my list is bringing down your cost of living. That will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. Inact the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on groceries. And fight to make sure that hard-working Americans can actually afford a place to live. And if you are caring for an elderly parent, my plan will cover the cost of home care under Medicare. So that seniors can get the help and care they need to stay in their own homes. And my plan will lower the cost of childcare, cut taxes for small businesses, and lower healthcare costs. Because I believe healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as last time. Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations. And this time, he will pay for it with a 20% Trump national sales tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average American family nearly $4,000 more a year. On top of that, you will pay even more if Donald Trump finally gets his way and ends the Affordable Care Act, which will throw, if he were to win, which would throw millions of Americans off their health insurance, and take us back to when insurance companies have the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was like? Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. Because, and we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we all remember how we got here. Donald Trump hands elected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did. And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, including in North Carolina and every state in the South except Virginia. Think about that. Many would know exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And Donald Trump, understand, he's not done. He would ban abortion nationwide. He would restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. Just Google Project 2025. Just Google it. Read the plans yourself and let us agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be making that decision for you. Not the government. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. So North Carolina, I am asking for your vote. I am asking for your vote. And here is my pledge to you. As your president, I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. And I pledge to you, I will listen to experts. I will listen to those impacted by the decisions I make and to people who disagree with me. And importantly, and Wally. All right. We're fighting. Hey everybody. Okay. You know, see this is the thing because we know we're actually fighting for a democracy. And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. And I pledge to be a president for all Americans and to always put country above party and self. So North Carolina, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. That's why we are here. And when you love something, you fight for it. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. And I have always believed in our nations, yes. And like all of us here, I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller where people of every walk of life came together to fight for the ideals of freedom and opportunity. I've lived the promise of America. I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chances our country gave her. Growing up, I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love who instilled in me the values that have always defined our nation best. Values like community, compassion, and faith. I've lived the promise of America. And I've spent my life fighting for the people, people who have been hurt and counted out, but never stop believing in our country that anything is possible. I've lived the promise of America. And I see the promise in all of you, in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom, in the men who support them, in Republicans who never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States before parting. I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. Let me see you. I love you guys because you are rightly impatient for change. You young leaders, you've only known the climate crisis and are leading the charge to protect our planet and our future. You young leaders who grew up with active shooter drills, who are trying to keep our schools safe. You who have known fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers and are standing up to fight for freedom, to make your own decisions about your own bodies. None of this for you young leaders is theoretical. This is not theoretical for you. It is not political for you. For our young leaders, this is your lived experience. And I see you and I see your power and I am so proud of you. Can we applaud all our first time voters and young leaders who are here? Let's applaud them. See? Our future is bright. I'm telling you, our future is bright. So, North Carolina, we have six days to get this done. And no one can sit on the sidelines. So, let's spend the next six days so that when we look back at these six days, we will know we did everything we could. So, right now, it's time to go out from here and knock on some doors. Time to text and call some voters. Time to reach out to family and friends and classmates and coworkers and neighbors. And as we do, let us please be intentional about building community. Let us please be intentional about building coalitions. Because through all of that, we strengthen our nation. Because we know and will always remember the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And we are all in this together. So remember, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. So, North Carolina, I then ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. God bless America. God bless America.

Home to remarkable natural beauty from the beaches to the mountain and everywhere in between. Home to a growing economy. But most importantly, home to exceptional people. Students who look out for each other, who step up in times of crisis, who rebuild and renew, who believe in brighter days and a stronger North Carolina. I'm running for governor because I love our home state. And I believe in its promise that if you work hard, where you come from should never limit how far you can go. To deliver on that promise, we must invest in our people and their futures so that together we build a safer, stronger North Carolina where the economy continues to grow and works for more people. Where our public schools are excellent and our teachers are well-paid, where our neighborhoods are safe and our personal freedoms are protected. And I want to underline one point. As your next governor, I will veto any further restrictions on women's reproductive freedom. Governing is not complicated. Put the people first and then fight for them. That's the job of Attorney General. When Kamala Harris was Attorney General of California, she prosecuted transnational drug organizations keeping her people safe. She took on big banks and delivered billions of dollars in relief to struggling homeowners. I got to work with her on the national mortgage settlement and I saw firsthand how she was committed to stopping Wall Street from abusing your street. As your Attorney General, I've been fighting for the people of our state and delivering. Whether it's eliminating what had been the largest backlog of untested rape kits in this entire nation, or securing the largest price gouging settlement in state history, or defending Obamacare successfully in the United States Supreme Court, or defending a woman's right to choose, or defending everyone's right to vote.

It is about fighting for every person, creating opportunity for every person, tapping the potential of every person so that together we build a better, brighter future for all of us. Donald Trump and Mark Robinson's vision is one of division, violence, and hate. Mark Robinson called public school teachers wicked, gay people filth. He disrespect women saying that they only have abortions because they can't keep their skirts down. Saying that women are not called to lead. Are there any women here who are called to lead? His vice president, Harris, called to lead. This summer, from a church pulpit of all places, he yelled, some folks need killing. But it's not just what he says, it's what he would do. Slash public school funding firing 13,000 educators, eliminating early voting and completely banning abortion in North Carolina without any exceptions. He denies that Joe Biden won the 2020 election. He denies the climate crisis that has devastated Western North Carolina. He denies the Holocaust. Friends, we must deny him the governorship of North Carolina. Because we want to build a better future. We choose hope over hate. We choose competence over chaos. We choose decency over division. Look, when North Carolinians come together, we do amazing things. Working together across the aisle under Governor Cooper's leadership, last year we expanded Medicaid in North Carolina. We have cracked down on the deadly scourge of Fendall. We have created good-paying jobs. To keep that path of progress, we must win races up and down the ballot. Folks, elections in North Carolina are always close, but that means that we have power. The power to determine who wins and who loses. And because the path to the presidency runs right through North Carolina, we have the power to shape the future not only of our home state, but this nation and the world. To possess that power is a privilege and a responsibility. We have six days left to use our power, to knock on doors, to post on social media, to talk to friends, family, and neighbors.",chunk_2,359

This is obviously something personal to all women and men in the fact that women's reproductive care is a very serious issue. To me, it's particularly personal. I have struggled with infertility and had my journey over the past 10 years. I have navigated dozens of IVF procedures, surgeries, setbacks, failures, things that politicians in DC and people authoring Project 2025 could never understand. In that process, I invested not just a lot of time and a good portion of my savings, but also a lot of emotional hope streams. In this process, I saw how legislative rules could really impact things unknowingly like IVF and the availability of IVF. When Trump brags, he likes to brag that he is proudly the person responsible for a returning row and unleashing extreme abortion bans across the country. If he is the father of IVF and he is not, I know this because I would have seen him in some of those dozen surgeries. If he would understand that this capricious allowing of Magna Republicans to insert themselves into these laws is absolutely going to jeopardize not just more lives and increase maternal mortality rates, it could prevent us, Greg and I, from starting the family that we desperately want to have. This is terrifying to me and I'm counting on you, North Carolina, to help make sure this does not happen. We know there is a clear choice in this election.

On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as last time. Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations. And this time, he will pay for it with a 20% Trump national sales tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average American family nearly $4,000 more a year. On top of that, you will pay even more if Donald Trump finally gets his way and ends the Affordable Care Act, which will throw, if he were to win, which would throw millions of Americans off their health insurance, and take us back to when insurance companies have the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was like? Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. Because, and we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we all remember how we got here. Donald Trump hands elected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did. And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, including in North Carolina and every state in the South except Virginia. Think about that. Many would know exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And Donald Trump, understand, he's not done. He would ban abortion nationwide. He would restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. Just Google Project 2025. Just Google it.

2024-10-31,Rally,"Harris holds rally in Las Vegas, Nevada",full,"My name is Vivian Arala and I'm the co-founder of South Asian Women's Alliance of Nevada and what an honor it is for me to be here amongst community leaders, residents, and people I just care about. This is home for me so it feels so right. And thank you for celebrating Diwali, a momentous occasion for Indians and South Asians across the globe. Today is a very auspicious day. Indians and South Asians are celebrating with families and friends and guess what they're doing? They're choosing light over darkness. They're choosing goodness over evil and they're choosing knowledge over ignorance and how momentous is that that I'm here right now right here celebrating Diwali but also talking about what's at stake here the selection cycle. Alright, to see a woman from my community and my culture being represented on the presidential ticket in this historic moment is just I'm just getting chills thinking about it and I can feel your energy today. Thank you here, thank you for your support of Vice President Kamala Harris. And Vice President Harris's vision for a new way forward is standing up for immigrants like myself, lowering costs for families like mine, and protecting women's rights like mine and others in Nevada and across this country. Yes, yeah, and these surely are the ideals that are near and dear to my heart. When my family and I immigrated to this country when I was just 10 years old, we were all in search of an American dream of supporting the next generation and giving us ourselves the resources we needed to thrive. And now I'm joined here somewhere with my husband Vijay and two sons, Shreyas and Azig, they're over there, yeah? And I often think about what's at stake for them and the futures that the futures that lie ahead of us. I want them to grow up in a world where they're celebrated for being first-generation Americans where they're able to stand up for their own rights and what they believe in and having a fair democracy for us all to participate within. These are just some of the ideals that Vice President Harris stands for and we all know that here today. But Donald Trump on the other hand, he says, boo, don't vote, yeah, that's right. But Donald Trump says that immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country. His project 2025 agenda will raise our costs, roll back our freedoms and threaten our democracy that we fought so hard for. While he's making his enemy list, Vice President Kamala Harris, Auntie Kamala, she's making her to-do list. That's right. Yeah. This is why I am so incredibly proud to vote and support Vice President Kamala Harris in this election cycle and I'm joined by a number of our South Asian community members here from Swan. Yes, we're all out there knocking on doors, making phone calls, sending text messages, making sure people are getting out to vote. We only have five days left of this election cycle. Every single message counts. Every single phone call counts. Every single outreach counts. Just bring them out there. You know where the polling locations are and it doesn't end here. We need to make sure that our voices are heard at the ballot box and beyond. And just so you know, we're having a sorry to the polls event tomorrow. I'm taking my mom to go vote at Deserbry's Community Center to elect the next President of United States, the first South Asian women president of the United States of America. Are you ready? Yeah. Thank you. Have a great day. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. In times again. Hey, you. Please welcome Carlos Eduardo Espina. Bitch, I might be better. Turn up the music. Turn down the lights. I got feeling. I'm gonna be alright. Okay. My name is Carlos Eduardo Espina and it is an honor to be here. For those of you who don't know me, I am the son of Uruguayan and Mexican immigrants who, like millions of others, came to the United States to fulfill the dreams and ambitions that in their home countries were impossible. My parents came here with very little, but through hard work and dedication, achieved their American dream of finding stability and prosperity. And I remember growing up, my parents always reminded me that the United States of America is the greatest country on earth. A place, a place where no dream is too big and no person too small. The land of opportunities where anything is possible. I took this to heart and today at just 25 years old, I am a proud graduate of UNLV Boyd School of Law. A non-profit director and the most followed Latino activists in the country with over 14 million followers on social media. And while I am proud of the life that we have made here in the United States, I worry that this beautiful country of opportunities and hope that allowed my family to achieve their dreams is an election away from being lost. Because unfortunately, we have a candidate in this race, Donald Trump, who does not believe in America and its defining values. He does not believe in democracy, individual freedoms, the working class, the American dream and decency. Instead, he wants to divide our nation and take us backwards. We're not going back. Trump's rhetoric, Trump's rhetoric, Trump's rhetoric and actions are not only dangerous, they are outright anti-American. But thankfully, thankfully, there is another candidate in this race, Kamala Harris. Someone who does believe in the values that make our country great. She embraces democracy, supports working class people, respects our military, values public education, understand that immigration makes us stronger and is overall just a much better human being. And that's why a few days ago, I proudly casted my vote for Kamala Harris. Not just for the sake of my future, but to ensure that our country remains the same beacon of freedom and opportunity that allowed my family and millions of others to achieve their American dreams. So let's go out, let's vote and let's get Kamala Harris elected. Thank you. Thank you and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

This is home for me so it feels so right. And thank you for celebrating Diwali, a momentous occasion for Indians and South Asians across the globe. Today is a very auspicious day. Indians and South Asians are celebrating with families and friends and guess what they're doing? They're choosing light over darkness. They're choosing goodness over evil and they're choosing knowledge over ignorance and how momentous is that that I'm here right now right here celebrating Diwali but also talking about what's at stake here the selection cycle. Alright, to see a woman from my community and my culture being represented on the presidential ticket in this historic moment is just I'm just getting chills thinking about it and I can feel your energy today. Thank you here, thank you for your support of Vice President Kamala Harris. And Vice President Harris's vision for a new way forward is standing up for immigrants like myself, lowering costs for families like mine, and protecting women's rights like mine and others in Nevada and across this country. Yes, yeah, and these surely are the ideals that are near and dear to my heart. When my family and I immigrated to this country when I was just 10 years old, we were all in search of an American dream of supporting the next generation and giving us ourselves the resources we needed to thrive. And now I'm joined here somewhere with my husband Vijay and two sons, Shreyas and Azig, they're over there, yeah? And I often think about what's at stake for them and the futures that the futures that lie ahead of us. I want them to grow up in a world where they're celebrated for being first-generation Americans where they're able to stand up for their own rights and what they believe in and having a fair democracy for us all to participate within. These are just some of the ideals that Vice President Harris stands for and we all know that here today.",chunk_1,372

But Donald Trump says that immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country. His project 2025 agenda will raise our costs, roll back our freedoms and threaten our democracy that we fought so hard for. While he's making his enemy list, Vice President Kamala Harris, Auntie Kamala, she's making her to-do list. That's right. Yeah. This is why I am so incredibly proud to vote and support Vice President Kamala Harris in this election cycle and I'm joined by a number of our South Asian community members here from Swan. Yes, we're all out there knocking on doors, making phone calls, sending text messages, making sure people are getting out to vote. We only have five days left of this election cycle. Every single message counts. Every single phone call counts. Every single outreach counts. Just bring them out there. You know where the polling locations are and it doesn't end here. We need to make sure that our voices are heard at the ballot box and beyond. And just so you know, we're having a sorry to the polls event tomorrow. I'm taking my mom to go vote at Deserbry's Community Center to elect the next President of United States, the first South Asian women president of the United States of America. Are you ready? Yeah. Thank you. Have a great day. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. In times again. Hey, you. Please welcome Carlos Eduardo Espina. Bitch, I might be better. Turn up the music. Turn down the lights. I got feeling. I'm gonna be alright. Okay. My name is Carlos Eduardo Espina and it is an honor to be here. For those of you who don't know me, I am the son of Uruguayan and Mexican immigrants who, like millions of others, came to the United States to fulfill the dreams and ambitions that in their home countries were impossible. My parents came here with very little, but through hard work and dedication, achieved their American dream of finding stability and prosperity. And I remember growing up, my parents always reminded me that the United States of America is the greatest country on earth.",chunk_2,375
2024-10-31,Rally,"Harris holds rally in Las Vegas, Nevada",chunk,"A place, a place where no dream is too big and no person too small. The land of opportunities where anything is possible. I took this to heart and today at just 25 years old, I am a proud graduate of UNLV Boyd School of Law. A non-profit director and the most followed Latino activists in the country with over 14 million followers on social media. And while I am proud of the life that we have made here in the United States, I worry that this beautiful country of opportunities and hope that allowed my family to achieve their dreams is an election away from being lost. Because unfortunately, we have a candidate in this race, Donald Trump, who does not believe in America and its defining values. He does not believe in democracy, individual freedoms, the working class, the American dream and decency. Instead, he wants to divide our nation and take us backwards. We're not going back. Trump's rhetoric, Trump's rhetoric, Trump's rhetoric and actions are not only dangerous, they are outright anti-American. But thankfully, thankfully, there is another candidate in this race, Kamala Harris. Someone who does believe in the values that make our country great. She embraces democracy, supports working class people, respects our military, values public education, understand that immigration makes us stronger and is overall just a much better human being. And that's why a few days ago, I proudly casted my vote for Kamala Harris. Not just for the sake of my future, but to ensure that our country remains the same beacon of freedom and opportunity that allowed my family and millions of others to achieve their American dreams.

2024-10-31,Rally,Kamala Harris full speech at campaign rally in Nevada,full,"Hello Nevada! Hello Nevada! We're going to Nevada! Happy Nevada Day! Thank you and please hear it for Misha! Oh it's good to be back! Oh it's good to be back! Oh it's good to be back! I have spent a lot of time in Reno over the years and it is so good to be back in Reno. Are we ready to do this? Are we ready to vote? Are we ready to win? It is so good to be back and with so many incredible leaders and I want to just start by thanking everyone here for taking time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon for us. To celebrate each other and community and I thank you everyone. I want to thank my dear dear friend Senator Catherine Cortez Mastow. As you know we were AGs together. I was in California and she was here. We were fighting a good fight arm in arm always together. I want to thank Mayor Sheevy, DNC Chair Jamie Harrison, Michael Gordon with Launa Local 169, and Nevada Police and Jackie Rosen back to the United States Senate. And to all the tribal, elected, and community leaders with us today. I thank you. So Reno, tomorrow, well by the way, Happy Halloween! So tomorrow, Friday, November 1st is the last day to vote early in person. And if you are voting by mail, please do not wait. Sign the envelope and return your ballot today. Your ballot must be returned to a drop box or postmarked by Election Day next Tuesday, November 5th. So please help get the word out and ask people to go to www.IwillVote.com if they are not sure. Let's spread the word. And we need you to vote Nevada. You are going to make the difference in the outcome of this election. And I thank you. I thank you. So okay, we got some work to do. Okay, we have five days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And we do have work to do. But here's the thing I know about everybody here. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We will win. And one of the reasons we will win is because I know who the folks are here. I know who you are. And here's the thing about all of us. We know that when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. And we know we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're exhausted by it. We're done with that. We're done with it. And Reno, this is the thing. We know that this is not who we are. That's not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States. And Nevada, we're going to... Thank you. All right. Okay. Okay. We got work to do. We got work to do. So listen, but let me say this. And a lot of folks here know I am not afraid of tough fights. For decades as a prosecutor and as top law enforcement officer of the first cousin in Nevada, California, I won fights. I won fights with Catherine against the big banks that ripped off homeowners. Against for profit colleges that scammed veterans and students. Against predators who harmed women and children. Against the cartels that trafficked in guns and drugs and human beings. And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way of fighting for you. For the people. And look, we know who Donald Trump is. Because we all know he is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. And this is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge. Consumed with grievance. And he's out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, either he or I will be sitting in the Oval Office. And listen, here's what we can imagine, right? We've all seen on TV, you've seen in the Oval Office, but here's the thing. Just we have to get the word out to help people even just visually imagine what that day will be. Because if elected, Donald Trump on day one would walk into that office with an enemy's list. When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list on behalf of you. And at the top of my list is bringing down your cost of living that will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. Enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. I've taken on that issue before, I'll take it on again. I will make housing more affordable by building more homes and taking on corporate landlords who unfairly buy up all these properties and jack up rents. We will fight for working families by raising the minimum wage and eliminating taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers. And if you're caring for an elderly parent, I took care of my mother when she was sick. Listen, this is personal for me as so many of these issues. If you are taking care of an elderly parent, my plan will cover the cost of home health care for seniors with Medicare. So you don't have to deplete whatever savings you've got to qualify for Medicaid. It's just about dignity so that seniors can stay in their homes and you can be able to do all that you need to do, especially if any of you are in the sandwich generation raising young kids while you're taking care of your parents. It's just about dignity. My plan will lower the cost of child care, same point. We will also cut taxes for small businesses. Can I see the small business owners who are here? Oh, I love our small businesses. And we will lower health care costs because here's where I come from. I believe that health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. So this is about values, right? How do you think about what people need to live with dignity, to live where they are able to work and know that it actually means something that is not just about getting by but getting ahead? On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as it was the last time. Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations. And this time he will pay for it with a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Just imagine, on clothes, food, toys, cell phones, a Trump sales tax that economists have measured will cost you on average an additional $4,000 a year. And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. And he has a very powerful friend in Congress, the Speaker of the House, who recently, if you notice, said that there will be a quote, end to Obamacare, the words used were no Obamacare, which if he were to get his way if Trump wins means they would throw millions of Americans off the health insurance and take us back, which would take us back to when you'll remember insurance companies had the ability to deny people with preexisting conditions. But Nevada, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. And we are not going back because ours, ours is a fight for the future. And ours is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we all remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. They did. And now one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exceptions for rapists have, you know what, let me say something about this. We're here because we're fighting for a democracy. Fighting for a democracy. And understand the difference here. Understand the difference here. Moving forward. Moving forward. Understand the difference here. What we are looking at is a difference in this election. Let's move forward and see where we are. Because on the issue, for example, of freedom of choice. That's all right. That's all right. That's okay. That's all right. You know what? Democracy can be complicated sometimes. It's okay. We're fighting for the right for people to be heard in that jail because they speak their mind. We know what's at stake. And on the issue of freedom. Listen, Donald Trump's not done. Did anybody hear what he had to say just yesterday? And I'll tell you, it was outrageous. So he said on the issue of freedom of choice, reproductive freedom, he said that he will do what he wants because quote, this is his perspective. He will do it whether the women like it or not. Whether the women like it or not. Can you imagine? And this is not the first time he has told us. He does not believe women should have authority or agency over their own bodies. This is the same person who said that women should be punished for their choices. And what we know is we know what we are seeing. This is someone who simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to make decisions about their own lives. And we know that what he has planned includes a national abortion ban, restricting access to birth control, putting IVF treatments at risk, and forcing states to monitor women's pregnancies. You don't have to take my word for Google Project 2025. Read the plans for yourselves. And I know we all know that one does not have to abandon their faith or reasonably held beliefs to agree that the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. So, Nevada, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, vote yes on question 6. And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right. And I will tell you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. So, Nevada, I am here asking for your vote. I am asking for your vote. And here is my pledge to you. And I got your back. As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. And I pledge to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, and to listen to people who disagree with me. Because that's what real leaders do. That's what real leaders do. And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that the people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. That's what leadership looks like. And I pledge to you to always put country above party and self and to be a president for all Americans. So it all comes down to this. We are all here together. And again, you are taking this time to be here. Because we love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, of our expression of our love for our country, to then fight for the ideals of our country, and to fight to realize the promise of America. And I'm going to tell you, I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller. And at those places, people from all walks of life came together to fight for the ideals of freedom and opportunity. You know, growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chance our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love. Who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith. I've spent my life fighting for the people who have been hurt and who have been counted out. And people who never stopped even then believing that in our country anything is possible. I've lived the promise of America, and I see the promise of America in everyone here. It is in all of us. It is in all of us. It is in all of us. It is in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. It is in the men who support them. It is in the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future. It is in the Republicans who never voted for a Democrat before, but have put the Constitution of the United States above parties. I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. And I'll tell you what I love about this generation, Gen Z. I'm going to shout you out. I'm going to tell you what I love about you all, you leaders, you young leaders, as you are rightly impatient for change. I love that about you. You are determined to live free from gun violence, to take on the climate crisis, to shape the world that you inherit. I love that about you. And for them, I say to everybody else, look, none of this is theoretical. This for them is a lived experience. It's not political. It's what they're living. And to the young leaders, then I say, I see you. I believe in you, and I see your power. You are so powerful. And I would just ask, can we give it up for the first time voters who are in the House? Right. See, I'm telling you, our future is bright. You just have to see it in front of you. The future of our country is bright. And so to the people of Nevada, look, you are battle-born. And we are ready for the hard work ahead. We have five days to get it done. And so look, nobody can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next five days so that when we look back on these days, we have no regrets. And let us make sure that we are knocking on doors, that we are texting folks, calling folks, reaching out to family and friends and classmates and neighbors and coworkers. And as we do, I have a request. As we do, please, let's be intentional about building community. And let's be intentional about building coalitions. You know, these last many years, it's had a way of, you know, trying to make people point their fingers at each other. Trying to divide us, trying to make people feel alone. So let us all, in this moment, be intentional about building back up and reminding folks, we have so much more in common than what separates us. So much more. So much more. And so we all know here, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. So today, Nevada, I asked you then, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless you, United States.",full,2769
2024-10-31,Rally,Kamala Harris full speech at campaign rally in Nevada,chunk,"Hello Nevada! Hello Nevada! We're going to Nevada! Happy Nevada Day! Thank you and please hear it for Misha!

To celebrate each other and community and I thank you everyone. I want to thank my dear dear friend Senator Catherine Cortez Mastow. As you know we were AGs together.

Let's spread the word. And we need you to vote Nevada. You are going to make the difference in the outcome of this election. And I thank you. I thank you. So okay, we got some work to do. Okay, we have five days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And we do have work to do. But here's the thing I know about everybody here. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We will win. And one of the reasons we will win is because I know who the folks are here. I know who you are.",chunk_1,404
2024-10-31,Rally,Kamala Harris full speech at campaign rally in Nevada,chunk,"And here's the thing about all of us. We know that when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. And we know we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're exhausted by it. We're done with that. We're done with it. And Reno, this is the thing. We know that this is not who we are. That's not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States. And Nevada, we're going to.. Thank you. All right. Okay. Okay. We got work to do. We got work to do. So listen, but let me say this. And a lot of folks here know I am not afraid of tough fights. For decades as a prosecutor and as top law enforcement officer of the first cousin in Nevada, California, I won fights. I won fights with Catherine against the big banks that ripped off homeowners. Against for profit colleges that scammed veterans and students. Against predators who harmed women and children. Against the cartels that trafficked in guns and drugs and human beings. And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way of fighting for you. For the people. And look, we know who Donald Trump is. Because we all know he is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. And this is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge. Consumed with grievance. And he's out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, either he or I will be sitting in the Oval Office. And listen, here's what we can imagine, right? We've all seen on TV, you've seen in the Oval Office, but here's the thing. Just we have to get the word out to help people even just visually imagine what that day will be. Because if elected, Donald Trump on day one would walk into that office with an enemy's list. When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list on behalf of you.",chunk_2,401
2024-10-31,Rally,Kamala Harris full speech at campaign rally in Nevada,chunk,"And at the top of my list is bringing down your cost of living that will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. Enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. I've taken on that issue before, I'll take it on again. I will make housing more affordable by building more homes and taking on corporate landlords who unfairly buy up all these properties and jack up rents. We will fight for working families by raising the minimum wage and eliminating taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers. And if you're caring for an elderly parent, I took care of my mother when she was sick. Listen, this is personal for me as so many of these issues. If you are taking care of an elderly parent, my plan will cover the cost of home health care for seniors with Medicare. So you don't have to deplete whatever savings you've got to qualify for Medicaid. It's just about dignity so that seniors can stay in their homes and you can be able to do all that you need to do, especially if any of you are in the sandwich generation raising young kids while you're taking care of your parents. It's just about dignity. My plan will lower the cost of child care, same point. We will also cut taxes for small businesses. Can I see the small business owners who are here? Oh, I love our small businesses. And we will lower health care costs because here's where I come from. I believe that health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. So this is about values, right? How do you think about what people need to live with dignity, to live where they are able to work and know that it actually means something that is not just about getting by but getting ahead? On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as it was the last time. Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations. And this time he will pay for it with a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported.",chunk_3,388
2024-10-31,Rally,Kamala Harris full speech at campaign rally in Nevada,chunk,"Just imagine, on clothes, food, toys, cell phones, a Trump sales tax that economists have measured will cost you on average an additional $4,000 a year. And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. And he has a very powerful friend in Congress, the Speaker of the House, who recently, if you notice, said that there will be a quote, end to Obamacare, the words used were no Obamacare, which if he were to get his way if Trump wins means they would throw millions of Americans off the health insurance and take us back, which would take us back to when you'll remember insurance companies had the ability to deny people with preexisting conditions. But Nevada, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. And we are not going back because ours, ours is a fight for the future. And ours is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we all remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. They did. And now one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exceptions for rapists have, you know what, let me say something about this. We're here because we're fighting for a democracy. Fighting for a democracy. And understand the difference here. Understand the difference here. Moving forward. Moving forward. Understand the difference here. What we are looking at is a difference in this election. Let's move forward and see where we are. Because on the issue, for example, of freedom of choice. That's all right. That's all right. That's okay. That's all right. You know what? Democracy can be complicated sometimes. It's okay. We're fighting for the right for people to be heard in that jail because they speak their mind. We know what's at stake. And on the issue of freedom.",chunk_4,374
2024-10-31,Rally,Kamala Harris full speech at campaign rally in Nevada,chunk,"Listen, Donald Trump's not done. Did anybody hear what he had to say just yesterday? And I'll tell you, it was outrageous. So he said on the issue of freedom of choice, reproductive freedom, he said that he will do what he wants because quote, this is his perspective. He will do it whether the women like it or not. Whether the women like it or not. Can you imagine? And this is not the first time he has told us. He does not believe women should have authority or agency over their own bodies. This is the same person who said that women should be punished for their choices. And what we know is we know what we are seeing. This is someone who simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to make decisions about their own lives. And we know that what he has planned includes a national abortion ban, restricting access to birth control, putting IVF treatments at risk, and forcing states to monitor women's pregnancies. You don't have to take my word for Google Project 2025. Read the plans for yourselves. And I know we all know that one does not have to abandon their faith or reasonably held beliefs to agree that the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. So, Nevada, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, vote yes on question 6. And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right. And I will tell you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. So, Nevada, I am here asking for your vote. I am asking for your vote. And here is my pledge to you. And I got your back. As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. And I pledge to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, and to listen to people who disagree with me. Because that's what real leaders do.",chunk_5,382
2024-10-31,Rally,Kamala Harris full speech at campaign rally in Nevada,chunk,"That's what real leaders do. And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that the people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. That's what leadership looks like. And I pledge to you to always put country above party and self and to be a president for all Americans. So it all comes down to this. We are all here together. And again, you are taking this time to be here. Because we love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, of our expression of our love for our country, to then fight for the ideals of our country, and to fight to realize the promise of America. And I'm going to tell you, I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller. And at those places, people from all walks of life came together to fight for the ideals of freedom and opportunity. You know, growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chance our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love. Who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith. I've spent my life fighting for the people who have been hurt and who have been counted out. And people who never stopped even then believing that in our country anything is possible. I've lived the promise of America, and I see the promise of America in everyone here. It is in all of us. It is in all of us. It is in all of us. It is in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. It is in the men who support them. It is in the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future. It is in the Republicans who never voted for a Democrat before, but have put the Constitution of the United States above parties. I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time.",chunk_6,399

I'm going to tell you what I love about you all, you leaders, you young leaders, as you are rightly impatient for change. I love that about you. You are determined to live free from gun violence, to take on the climate crisis, to shape the world that you inherit. I love that about you. And for them, I say to everybody else, look, none of this is theoretical. This for them is a lived experience. It's not political. It's what they're living. And to the young leaders, then I say, I see you. I believe in you, and I see your power. You are so powerful. And I would just ask, can we give it up for the first time voters who are in the House? Right. See, I'm telling you, our future is bright. You just have to see it in front of you. The future of our country is bright. And so to the people of Nevada, look, you are battle-born.

2024-11-02,Rally,"Kamala Harris full speech at campaign rally in North Carolina
",full,"Oh, it's good to be back. It's good to be back. Charlotte, are we ready to do this? Yes. Are we ready to vote? Yes. Are we ready to win? Yes. Oh, it's good to be back. It is good to be back. And it is good to be back with so many friends and so many leaders. And I want to thank everyone for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here. We do. And we are here together. And I thank you all so very much. Governor Cooper, you are a dear friend. You are an incredible leader. I thank you. Your next Governor, Josh Stein. Your next Attorney General, Jeff Jackson. Your next Attorney General, John Bon Jovi. Your next Attorney General, John Bon Jovi. Your next Attorney General, John Bon Jovi. Your next Attorney General, John Bon Jovi. All right, North Carolina. So we have three days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And we still have work to do. We still have work to do. But here's the thing I know about everybody here. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We will win. And here's part of the deal on that. We will win because when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. And we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're done. We're exhausted with it. We're done. And we know who he is. We know who he is. He tells us every day. But Charlotte, that's not who we are. That's not who we are. And we know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. And know what, Carolina? Here's the thing. You know me. You know me. I'm not afraid of tough fights. I've been a prosecutor and top law enforcement officer in the biggest state in our country. I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners. I won fights against profit colleges that scammed veterans and students. Against predators who abused women and children. I won fights against the cartels that traffic and guns and drugs and human beings. I pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. And look, we know who Donald Trump is. This is so right. We do, don't we? And here's one of the things we know about him. This is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. And this is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and the man is out for unchecked power. So look, in less than 90 days, it's either going to be him or me sitting in the Oval Office. We're going to do this. Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump Friends, right? So this is the thing that we want to share with folks, just to imagine, right, what this means and the choice that is in front of us. Imagine and let's ask the friends who are not here to imagine the Oval Office. You've seen it on TV, right? Imagine the Oval Office and if he is elected, Donald Trump on day one would be sitting in that office, stewing over his enemies list. But when I am elected, I will walk in on your behalf working on my to-do list. And at the top of my list is bringing down the cost of living for you. That will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. Fight to make sure that hard-working Americans can actually afford a place to live. And if you are caring for an elderly parent, my plan will cover the cost of home care under Medicare. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. You know what? One of the reasons we are here is because we are fighting for a democracy and the right of people to speak their mind, but right now I am speaking. So bringing down the cost of living for you includes making sure that we are caring for those who are caring for others. It's okay. Democracy can be complicated. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. This is what democracy looks like. So included in the work we will do is ensuring that Medicare covers the cost of home healthcare for seniors. And I will tell you a lot of how I think about these policies is based on my own experiences. When my mother was sick, I took care of her. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. Hey, listen, it's all good. And look, we all want that war in the Middle East to end. We want the Oslo Dages home. And when I am president, I will do everything in my power to make it so. So so much about what I care about on your behalf is truly about dignity. It is about dignity. It is about the importance of lifting people up and not trying to tear them down. Which is why my plan will lower the cost of childcare, cut taxes for small businesses. Do we have small business owners in the right? Here we do. I love our small businesses. You all are part of the big backbone of America's economy. Keep doing what you do. I love our small businesses. I love our small businesses. I love our small businesses. And our work will include lowering healthcare costs because where I come from in terms of how I think about this, access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face, same as it was last time, another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations. And this time he will pay for it with a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Clothes, food, toys, cell phones, a Trump sales tax that economists have estimated will cost you an additional $4,000 a year. And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which would throw millions of Americans off their health insurance and take us back to the time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was? Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we all remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court. And with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, they did as he intended. And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, including North Carolina and every state in the South except Virginia. Many would no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral and understand Donald Trump is not done. He would ban abortion nationwide. He would restrict access to birth control. He would put IVF treatments at risk and get this forced states to monitor women's pregnancies. Just Google Project 2025, which still I can't believe they put in writing. And I think everyone here knows one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. Not the government and not Donald Trump. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. Proudly. So North Carolina, I'm here to ask for your vote. I'm here to ask for your vote. And here, and here is my pledge to you. As president, I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. And I pledge to you to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to people who disagree with me. Because you see, unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I will give them a seat at the table. And I pledge to you to listen to what the real leadership looks like. That's what strong leadership looks like. And I pledge to always put country above party and self, and to be a president for all Americans. So that is my pledge to you, Charlotte. And let me then ask, who here has already voted? Wow! All right! Well, I thank you! So now I'm going to ask you just please talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors. And seriously, please share with them, you've taken such time out of all the other obligations you have. You've taken such time to be here. So please do share with them why you have taken this time. And what your perspective is on this election is so important. And please encourage people. I love you back. And let's encourage everyone to know the strength of their voice. And for anyone who hasn't voted yet, look, first of all, no judgment. But please do get to it. And please take a moment to think about your plan for voting, about when and where you will vote. Election Day is Tuesday, November 5th. Polls are open here in North Carolina from 6.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. Go to IWILLVOTE.COM for any information you need about when and where to vote. Because listen, we need everyone to vote North Carolina. You all will make the difference in this election. You will make the difference. So look, it all comes down to this. We are all here together because we love our country. We love our country. USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!

USA And what we all know about that time is there were folks from every background, every walk of life coming together to fight for freedom and for opportunity. And growing up I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chances our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love who instilled in me the values of community. And compassion and faith. And I have spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out but who never stop believing that in our country anything is possible. I have lived the promise of America. And today I see the promise of America in everybody who is here. In all of you, in all of us, we are the promise of America. We are the promise of America. In the fathers and the mothers and the grandparents who work every day for our children's lives. In the future, in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. And the men who support them. I see it in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but who are putting Constitution of the United States over party. I see the promise of America every day in the young leaders who are voting for the first time. Where are you? Where are you? Let me see you. Right? I love you guys. I love Gen Z. I love Gen Z. I love this generation. And because you know here's the thing, you all are rightly impatient for change. They are impatient for change. You are determined to live free from gun violence, to take on the climate crisis, and to shape the world you will inherit. I know that. And for this generation, none of these issues is theoretical. These issues are not political. This is a lived experience for you all. And I see you. And I see your power. And I see your purpose. And I am so proud of you. Can we hear it for the first time voters? I'm telling you, the future of our nation is bright. It is bright. We have so much to be optimistic about. So we got three days to get this done. And no one can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next three days. So when we look back three days from now, we will have no regrets about what we could have done. Let's knock on doors. Let's text. Let's call. Reach out to your family, your friends, your classmates, your neighbors, your coworkers, your play cousins. You know what I'm saying. And please during the course of these next three days, I ask, let us please be intentional about building community. Let us be intentional about building community. You know, there's something about this whole Trump era that really was to try and suggest that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. Instead of what we know, the real strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. Let's be intentional about building community. And let's be intentional about building coalitions. Remembering that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And there is power in that. There is power in that approach. And it will strengthen our country. And so I'll leave you with this. Let's remember and please remind everyone, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. And don't let anyone ever take your power from you. So North Carolina, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. God bless you.",full,2790

And it is good to be back with so many friends and so many leaders. And I want to thank everyone for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here. We do. And we are here together. And I thank you all so very much. Governor Cooper, you are a dear friend. You are an incredible leader. I thank you. Your next Governor, Josh Stein. Your next Attorney General, Jeff Jackson.

So we have three days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And we still have work to do. We still have work to do. But here's the thing I know about everybody here. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We will win. And here's part of the deal on that. We will win because when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. And we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're done. We're exhausted with it. We're done. And we know who he is. We know who he is. He tells us every day. But Charlotte, that's not who we are. That's not who we are. And we know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. And know what, Carolina? Here's the thing. You know me. You know me. I'm not afraid of tough fights. I've been a prosecutor and top law enforcement officer in the biggest state in our country. I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners. I won fights against profit colleges that scammed veterans and students. Against predators who abused women and children.",chunk_1,403

I pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. And look, we know who Donald Trump is. This is so right. We do, don't we? And here's one of the things we know about him. This is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. And this is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and the man is out for unchecked power. So look, in less than 90 days, it's either going to be him or me sitting in the Oval Office. We're going to do this. Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump Friends, right? So this is the thing that we want to share with folks, just to imagine, right, what this means and the choice that is in front of us. Imagine and let's ask the friends who are not here to imagine the Oval Office. You've seen it on TV, right? Imagine the Oval Office and if he is elected, Donald Trump on day one would be sitting in that office, stewing over his enemies list. But when I am elected, I will walk in on your behalf working on my to-do list. And at the top of my list is bringing down the cost of living for you. That will be my focus every single day as president.",chunk_2,362

",chunk,"I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. Fight to make sure that hard-working Americans can actually afford a place to live. And if you are caring for an elderly parent, my plan will cover the cost of home care under Medicare. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. You know what? One of the reasons we are here is because we are fighting for a democracy and the right of people to speak their mind, but right now I am speaking. So bringing down the cost of living for you includes making sure that we are caring for those who are caring for others. It's okay. Democracy can be complicated. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. This is what democracy looks like. So included in the work we will do is ensuring that Medicare covers the cost of home healthcare for seniors. And I will tell you a lot of how I think about these policies is based on my own experiences. When my mother was sick, I took care of her. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. Hey, listen, it's all good. And look, we all want that war in the Middle East to end. We want the Oslo Dages home. And when I am president, I will do everything in my power to make it so. So so much about what I care about on your behalf is truly about dignity. It is about dignity. It is about the importance of lifting people up and not trying to tear them down. Which is why my plan will lower the cost of childcare, cut taxes for small businesses. Do we have small business owners in the right? Here we do. I love our small businesses. You all are part of the big backbone of America's economy. Keep doing what you do. I love our small businesses. I love our small businesses. I love our small businesses. And our work will include lowering healthcare costs because where I come from in terms of how I think about this, access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face, same as it was last time, another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations.",chunk_3,419

",chunk,"And this time he will pay for it with a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Clothes, food, toys, cell phones, a Trump sales tax that economists have estimated will cost you an additional $4,000 a year. And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which would throw millions of Americans off their health insurance and take us back to the time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was? Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we all remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court. And with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, they did as he intended. And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, including North Carolina and every state in the South except Virginia. Many would no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral and understand Donald Trump is not done. He would ban abortion nationwide. He would restrict access to birth control. He would put IVF treatments at risk and get this forced states to monitor women's pregnancies. Just Google Project 2025, which still I can't believe they put in writing. And I think everyone here knows one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. Not the government and not Donald Trump. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. Proudly. So North Carolina, I'm here to ask for your vote. I'm here to ask for your vote. And here, and here is my pledge to you. As president, I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face.",chunk_4,378

I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to people who disagree with me. Because you see, unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I will give them a seat at the table. And I pledge to you to listen to what the real leadership looks like. That's what strong leadership looks like. And I pledge to always put country above party and self, and to be a president for all Americans. So that is my pledge to you, Charlotte. And let me then ask, who here has already voted? Wow!

And I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love who instilled in me the values of community. And compassion and faith. And I have spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out but who never stop believing that in our country anything is possible. I have lived the promise of America. And today I see the promise of America in everybody who is here. In all of you, in all of us, we are the promise of America. We are the promise of America. In the fathers and the mothers and the grandparents who work every day for our children's lives. In the future, in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. And the men who support them. I see it in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but who are putting Constitution of the United States over party. I see the promise of America every day in the young leaders who are voting for the first time. Where are you? Where are you? Let me see you. Right? I love you guys. I love Gen Z. I love Gen Z. I love this generation. And because you know here's the thing, you all are rightly impatient for change. They are impatient for change. You are determined to live free from gun violence, to take on the climate crisis, and to shape the world you will inherit. I know that. And for this generation, none of these issues is theoretical. These issues are not political. This is a lived experience for you all. And I see you. And I see your power. And I see your purpose. And I am so proud of you. Can we hear it for the first time voters? I'm telling you, the future of our nation is bright. It is bright. We have so much to be optimistic about. So we got three days to get this done. And no one can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next three days. So when we look back three days from now, we will have no regrets about what we could have done. Let's knock on doors.

You know, there's something about this whole Trump era that really was to try and suggest that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. Instead of what we know, the real strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. Let's be intentional about building community. And let's be intentional about building coalitions. Remembering that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And there is power in that. There is power in that approach. And it will strengthen our country. And so I'll leave you with this. Let's remember and please remind everyone, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. And don't let anyone ever take your power from you. So North Carolina, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. God bless you.",chunk_7,222

Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. And we will win because when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. And Georgia, we have an opportunity in this election to finally turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump who spends full time trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We are exhausted with that. Enough of that. Enough. And we're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. And we are not going back. And one of the reasons is because we do know the contrast and we know who he is, but Atlanta, that's not who we are. That's not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. And Georgia, you know me. I'm not afraid of tough fights. Evidently. For decades, I was a prosecutor. I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state, and I won fights against the big banks who ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children, against cartels that trafficked and guns and drugs and human beings. I won those fights. And I pledge to you if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. And look, we know who Donald Trump is. And because we know this is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and the man is out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, is he going to be him or me in the Oval Office? Yes! And here's the thing. So, help spread the word because part of it is to help people imagine. You can imagine in your mind the Oval Office, right? So, just imagine, if he is elected on day one, Donald Trump would walk in that Oval Office with his enemies list, stewing over an enemy's list. When I am elected, I will walk in on your behalf with my to-do list. My to-do list. And at the top of my list is bringing down the cost of your life to you. And that will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. We need a medic over here, please. We need a medic over here. So, one can just part a little bit so we can let somebody through. Okay? Okay. All right. See, this is what we do. We look out for each other. That's how we roll. That's how we roll. And that's what leadership looks like. Everybody here. And among the things I also on my to-do list is to fight to make sure that hard-working Americans can actually afford a place to live. Affordable housing. One of the highest priorities. My priorities include knowing that if you are caring for an elderly parent, we need to cover the cost of home care with Medicare. Which we will do.

We will win. And we will win because when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. And Georgia, we have an opportunity in this election to finally turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump who spends full time trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We are exhausted with that. Enough of that. Enough. And we're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. And we are not going back. And one of the reasons is because we do know the contrast and we know who he is, but Atlanta, that's not who we are. That's not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. And Georgia, you know me. I'm not afraid of tough fights. Evidently. For decades, I was a prosecutor. I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state, and I won fights against the big banks who ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children, against cartels that trafficked and guns and drugs and human beings. I won those fights. And I pledge to you if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. And look, we know who Donald Trump is. And because we know this is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and the man is out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, is he going to be him or me in the Oval Office? Yes! And here's the thing. So, help spread the word because part of it is to help people imagine. You can imagine in your mind the Oval Office, right?

2024-11-04,Rally,Kamala Harris rally in Allentown,full,"I want a president who's got the big heart like Kamala Harris. Folks, this is a moment where we have an opportunity to elect a good and honorable and decent soul. Someone I've known for two decades. I know it's in her heart and I know what she's capable of and she will deliver for us here in Pennsylvania. Now, we have an extraordinary power being here in Pennsylvania. It may be the one thing that Kamala Harris and Donald Trump agree on is that as Pennsylvania goes, so goes the nation when it comes to who the next president of the United States is. So you got a lot of power. And I would argue you've got immense responsibility here, not just to elect Kamala Harris, not just to elect Bob Casey, not just to elect Susan Wilde. But I think you've got a real responsibility here to help us write this next chapter in our American story. One that we can be proud to pass on to our children and our grandchildren. And I would say that this responsibility we have as Pennsylvanians isn't just because of our temporary status as the ultimate swing state in the nation. I would argue that it's a responsibility we've had for the last 248 years. It was 248 years ago where a band of patriots came together just down the road in Philadelphia and we declared our independence from a king and we are not going back to a king in this country. We're not going back. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. Now, for all you history majors here at Muhlenberg, it's a popular major apparently. You'll remember that about a decade later, those patriots gathered at Independence Hall again in Philadelphia and they signed the Constitution of the United States. It was an incomplete document. It didn't have all of us in mind. But the beauty of the Constitution is that it set our nation on this path of self determination where we, the people, would be the ones to guide the future of this great nation. Where we would come together and we would perfect our union over and over and over again. Where ordinary Americans would have the power to rise up, demand more, seek justice, and leave a better place for their children and their grandchildren. It was from that Constitution that we derived our power. But it was actually from a conversation that happened on the Cobbled Stone Streets just shortly after that Constitution was signed that gave us our charge as Americans. After signing the Constitution, one of my predecessors as governor, Ben Franklin, and it's true, he was my predecessor. Franklin walked out onto those Cobbled Stone Streets of Philadelphia. A woman walked over to him, think about this for a moment. Women didn't have the right to vote at that moment in America, yet a woman walks over to Franklin, looks him in the eye and says, So what do we have here? A monarchy or a republic? Franklin looked her in the eye and said, a republic, if you can keep it. Those five words, if you can keep it, that's been our charge, Pennsylvanians. That's been our direction from our founding fathers to do this hard work to build a more perfect union, to build a more tolerant and just and free society.

2024-11-04,Rally,Kamala Harris rally in Allentown,chunk,"I want a president who's got the big heart like Kamala Harris. Folks, this is a moment where we have an opportunity to elect a good and honorable and decent soul. Someone I've known for two decades. I know it's in her heart and I know what she's capable of and she will deliver for us here in Pennsylvania. Now, we have an extraordinary power being here in Pennsylvania. It may be the one thing that Kamala Harris and Donald Trump agree on is that as Pennsylvania goes, so goes the nation when it comes to who the next president of the United States is. So you got a lot of power. And I would argue you've got immense responsibility here, not just to elect Kamala Harris, not just to elect Bob Casey, not just to elect Susan Wilde. But I think you've got a real responsibility here to help us write this next chapter in our American story. One that we can be proud to pass on to our children and our grandchildren. And I would say that this responsibility we have as Pennsylvanians isn't just because of our temporary status as the ultimate swing state in the nation. I would argue that it's a responsibility we've had for the last 248 years. It was 248 years ago where a band of patriots came together just down the road in Philadelphia and we declared our independence from a king and we are not going back to a king in this country. We're not going back. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. Now, for all you history majors here at Muhlenberg, it's a popular major apparently. You'll remember that about a decade later, those patriots gathered at Independence Hall again in Philadelphia and they signed the Constitution of the United States. It was an incomplete document. It didn't have all of us in mind. But the beauty of the Constitution is that it set our nation on this path of self determination where we, the people, would be the ones to guide the future of this great nation. Where we would come together and we would perfect our union over and over and over again. Where ordinary Americans would have the power to rise up, demand more, seek justice, and leave a better place for their children and their grandchildren.",chunk_1,398
2024-11-04,Rally,Kamala Harris rally in Allentown,chunk,"It was from that Constitution that we derived our power. But it was actually from a conversation that happened on the Cobbled Stone Streets just shortly after that Constitution was signed that gave us our charge as Americans. After signing the Constitution, one of my predecessors as governor, Ben Franklin, and it's true, he was my predecessor. Franklin walked out onto those Cobbled Stone Streets of Philadelphia. A woman walked over to him, think about this for a moment. Women didn't have the right to vote at that moment in America, yet a woman walks over to Franklin, looks him in the eye and says, So what do we have here? A monarchy or a republic? Franklin looked her in the eye and said, a republic, if you can keep it. Those five words, if you can keep it, that's been our charge, Pennsylvanians. That's been our direction from our founding fathers to do this hard work to build a more perfect union, to build a more tolerant and just and free society. So are you with me to continue this work, Pennsylvania? Are you ready to fight for freedom? And are you ready to elect the 47th President of the United States, Madam President, Kamala Harris?

What's up, Philly? You all look so good tonight! Let me say I am so proud to be your governor, and every single day, I'm working for you to advance the cause of real freedom, and to get shit done here in Pennsylvania. And you know, in many ways, I think this election comes down to those same two things. Who's on your side fighting to get stuff done for you? And who will protect your freedom? Well, to me, and I think to all of you, the answer is clear, it's Kamala Harris! But it's not just Kamala's name that's on the ballot. It's your rights and your freedoms that are on the line. And Philly, I will tell you, I think it is our responsibility right now, just as our framers had intended to do our part. You see, 248 years ago, it was here in Philly, just down the street, that we declared our independence from a king. And hear me on this, we are not going back to a king in this country! No, we're not! A decade later, after signing the Constitution, Ben Franklin was met outside Independence Hall on the cobblestone street. He was greeted by a woman who asked him, What have we got? A monarchy or a republic? Franklin looked her in the eye and said, A republic if you can keep it. Those five words, if you can keep it, that has been our charge for centuries. And it has guided every chapter in our American story. To keep it, to perfect our union. And throughout our American story, it's been ordinary Americans, rising up, demanding more, seeking justice, and making progress. Now that progress has been made on the battlefield. At lunch counters, in marches, and at the ballot box. So tomorrow, when you use your pen to vote, and hear me on this, you all better stay inside those circles when you vote. Don't go outside the lines. I want you to use that pen to vote for Kamala Harris. And I want you to use that pen to help write this next chapter in our American story. A chapter where we declare that no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, or who you pray to, you'll have real opportunity here in America. Where the lessons we teach our children to love thy neighbor, to treat others with respect, are the foundational values guiding our next president. And so tomorrow, let us come together to write this next chapter where we are more free, more tolerant, and where we are united in the cause of liberty and justice for all. My fellow Pennsylvanians, my fellow Americans, the task now falls to each of us. And together, let us make history and elect Kamala Harris, the next president of the United States. May God bless you. Let's get to work, Philly. Let's make it happen. Thank you. Give it up one more time for Governor Shapiro! Now you know what Kamala Harris says. Hard work is good work. It's a model being embraced all across this country as folks come together to get out the vote. Here you can see what Philly's been up to. The field offices have been absolutely buzzing with folks from all walks of life signing up to knock on doors, make phone calls, and spread the word about the future we're fighting for. And we have some awesome organizers here in Philly showing them how it's done, because that's what this city is all about. Now this campaign is all about moving our nation forward, but for our next speaker, we're going to lean back. So ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Hip-Hop Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! A couple of years back, when I seen Donald Trump come down to escalator and call my Mexican brothers and sisters rapists and drug dealers, he obviously didn't know the contributions of Mexican Americans to this country. If you didn't believe him then, then we had Hurricane Maria, while people were moving and wastes high water, he went to Puerto Rico and threw towels, paper towels like they were basketballs at the Puerto Rican people. He also blocked aid to Puerto Rico for the Relief Fund. Kamala Harris is for us. She's for unity. She's for all Americans. Black, white, big, small, Latino. You name it, she's for us. One thing I won't do is sell my soul for anybody. If I'm out here telling you she's the one, it's because I know she's the one. A couple of weeks ago, I'm watching these people again. They told my Haitian brothers and sisters that they eat cats and dogs. Now I'm asking my Americans and my Latinos in particular, where's your pride? When is enough enough? When is enough enough? Kamala Harris brought five million new Latino jobs to America. Just the other day, what I call a hate rally in my neck of the woods, Madison Square Garden. Now let me tell you something, I'm a sucker for a laugh. I gotta let you know, I'm the guy they throw out the comedy show because I'm laughing too much. I think I'm a die of laughter. I find anything funny. But when they get up there and they call Puerto Rico an island of garbage. Tell me how you really feel, huh? I did not find that to be a joke. Disrespected Jewish people, black people talking about carving watermelons. I mean, this is out of control. But I asked my people, mi gente latino, donde está tu agulho? Where's your pride? So you can't keep getting stepped on and kicked when you're down. We got a Lex someone who's really for the people, Kamala Harris. She's for the people I believe in her. And if you're the last undisputed decided vote, you don't know who you're voting for. You got to be kidding me at this point. If we're going to vote for Kamala Harris tomorrow, let me hear you make some noise. Everybody get out there and vote because every vote matters. Your voice matters. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Fat Joe and I'm here for Kamala Harris, the next president of the United States of America. With that being said, I am introducing one of my friends, a fellow Vodiqua, one of the greatest international superstars of all time, Ricky Martin. Here we go. Are you ready? Come on, let me feel it. Lolo, Lolo, Lolo. Yo vengo con cosa buena para mi pueblo. Tengo amor, tengo el sesuero. Te alegra los corazones del nuevo entero. Val dolor, Val más te amore. Nada como el repique de mis camores. Que te quiera ir hacia acá y me dejando atrás los problemas. Que como decía mi madre bailando todo se arregla. Regate un poco más, te llamas los tambores, olvida los temores. Que el tiempo lleno se arregla. Te mueves a saber, salta cosa buena. Que a mí me fuentes para. Here we go. Tuve tus caneras, muchachan, morena. Baila ese ritmo con sabor a buena. Hay una pescetita, que sabe yo era. Para que te olvide, te dolas tus peras. Esta noche quiero más, esta noche quiero. Hoy no habrá mal que por viento venga. Unamos los corazones. Hoy todos somos multicolores. Regate un poco más, te llamas los tambores, olvida los temores. Que el tiempo lleno se arregla. Te mueves a saber, salta cosa buena. Que a mí me pone, come on, let me feel your heartbeat. Everybody come on, that's right. Y que venga el coro, con todo el amor. Para nuestros niños, que venga la paz. Y que venga todo, sabas la mi plena. Y un pegadito, con mucho cariñito que venga. Y que venga en ríos de monta. Para todos los pueblos de la tierra. Que no nos podemos olvidar. Que el amor porolivera y la mentira es venena. Que como decía mi madre, bailando todo se arregla. Pegate un poco más, te llamas los tambores, olvida los temores. Que el tiempo se lo va. Te mueves a saber, salta cosa buena. Que a mí me pone, come on, let me feel your heartbeat. Bring the fire, to my people. To the people in the United States. Come on, that's right, that's right. Here we go. Come on, that's right, that's right. But I can't get out in the night if that's all. Thank you, Fat Joe, and thank you, Ricky Martin. You know, they say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. But tomorrow, what happens in Vegas just might change our country forever. Because Nevada is ready to elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States of America. And Vegas is pulling out all the stops to get people to the polls, including the ultimate stop. They've activated the sphere. This baby's been lit up blue all week, reminding everyone to get out and vote. And for our next speaker, we're going to travel just down the road from the sphere to another iconic Vegas site. We know Vegas is Union strong. So let's make some noise as I pass the mic to the executive secretary treasurer of the Southern Nevada Building Trains Union, Vince Saavedra, live from the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

2024-11-04,Rally,Harris holds rally in Philadelphia ,chunk,"You see, 248 years ago, it was here in Philly, just down the street, that we declared our independence from a king. And hear me on this, we are not going back to a king in this country! No, we're not! A decade later, after signing the Constitution, Ben Franklin was met outside Independence Hall on the cobblestone street. He was greeted by a woman who asked him, What have we got? A monarchy or a republic? Franklin looked her in the eye and said, A republic if you can keep it. Those five words, if you can keep it, that has been our charge for centuries. And it has guided every chapter in our American story. To keep it, to perfect our union. And throughout our American story, it's been ordinary Americans, rising up, demanding more, seeking justice, and making progress. Now that progress has been made on the battlefield. At lunch counters, in marches, and at the ballot box. So tomorrow, when you use your pen to vote, and hear me on this, you all better stay inside those circles when you vote. Don't go outside the lines. I want you to use that pen to vote for Kamala Harris. And I want you to use that pen to help write this next chapter in our American story. A chapter where we declare that no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, or who you pray to, you'll have real opportunity here in America. Where the lessons we teach our children to love thy neighbor, to treat others with respect, are the foundational values guiding our next president. And so tomorrow, let us come together to write this next chapter where we are more free, more tolerant, and where we are united in the cause of liberty and justice for all. My fellow Pennsylvanians, my fellow Americans, the task now falls to each of us. And together, let us make history and elect Kamala Harris, the next president of the United States. May God bless you. Let's get to work, Philly. Let's make it happen. Thank you. Give it up one more time for Governor Shapiro! Now you know what Kamala Harris says. Hard work is good work.",chunk_2,375
2024-11-04,Rally,Harris holds rally in Philadelphia ,chunk,"It's a model being embraced all across this country as folks come together to get out the vote. Here you can see what Philly's been up to. The field offices have been absolutely buzzing with folks from all walks of life signing up to knock on doors, make phone calls, and spread the word about the future we're fighting for. And we have some awesome organizers here in Philly showing them how it's done, because that's what this city is all about. Now this campaign is all about moving our nation forward, but for our next speaker, we're going to lean back. So ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Hip-Hop Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! Icon and Bronx Native, my friend, Fat Joe! A couple of years back, when I seen Donald Trump come down to escalator and call my Mexican brothers and sisters rapists and drug dealers, he obviously didn't know the contributions of Mexican Americans to this country. If you didn't believe him then, then we had Hurricane Maria, while people were moving and wastes high water, he went to Puerto Rico and threw towels, paper towels like they were basketballs at the Puerto Rican people. He also blocked aid to Puerto Rico for the Relief Fund. Kamala Harris is for us. She's for unity. She's for all Americans. Black, white, big, small, Latino. You name it, she's for us. One thing I won't do is sell my soul for anybody. If I'm out here telling you she's the one, it's because I know she's the one. A couple of weeks ago, I'm watching these people again. They told my Haitian brothers and sisters that they eat cats and dogs. Now I'm asking my Americans and my Latinos in particular, where's your pride? When is enough enough? When is enough enough? Kamala Harris brought five million new Latino jobs to America.",chunk_3,390
2024-11-04,Rally,Harris holds rally in Philadelphia ,chunk,"Just the other day, what I call a hate rally in my neck of the woods, Madison Square Garden. Now let me tell you something, I'm a sucker for a laugh. I gotta let you know, I'm the guy they throw out the comedy show because I'm laughing too much. I think I'm a die of laughter. I find anything funny. But when they get up there and they call Puerto Rico an island of garbage. Tell me how you really feel, huh? I did not find that to be a joke. Disrespected Jewish people, black people talking about carving watermelons. I mean, this is out of control. But I asked my people, mi gente latino, donde está tu agulho? Where's your pride? So you can't keep getting stepped on and kicked when you're down. We got a Lex someone who's really for the people, Kamala Harris. She's for the people I believe in her. And if you're the last undisputed decided vote, you don't know who you're voting for. You got to be kidding me at this point. If we're going to vote for Kamala Harris tomorrow, let me hear you make some noise. Everybody get out there and vote because every vote matters. Your voice matters. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Fat Joe and I'm here for Kamala Harris, the next president of the United States of America. With that being said, I am introducing one of my friends, a fellow Vodiqua, one of the greatest international superstars of all time, Ricky Martin. Here we go. Are you ready? Come on, let me feel it. Lolo, Lolo, Lolo. Yo vengo con cosa buena para mi pueblo. Tengo amor, tengo el sesuero. Te alegra los corazones del nuevo entero. Val dolor, Val más te amore. Nada como el repique de mis camores. Que te quiera ir hacia acá y me dejando atrás los problemas. Que como decía mi madre bailando todo se arregla. Regate un poco más, te llamas los tambores, olvida los temores. Que el tiempo lleno se arregla. Te mueves a saber, salta cosa buena. Que a mí me fuentes para. Here we go. Tuve tus caneras, muchachan, morena. Baila ese ritmo con sabor a buena. Hay una pescetita, que sabe yo era. Para que te olvide, te dolas tus peras.",chunk_4,383

Regate un poco más, te llamas los tambores, olvida los temores. Que el tiempo lleno se arregla. Te mueves a saber, salta cosa buena. Que a mí me pone, come on, let me feel your heartbeat. Everybody come on, that's right. Y que venga el coro, con todo el amor. Para nuestros niños, que venga la paz. Y que venga todo, sabas la mi plena. Y un pegadito, con mucho cariñito que venga. Y que venga en ríos de monta. Para todos los pueblos de la tierra. Que no nos podemos olvidar. Que el amor porolivera y la mentira es venena. Que como decía mi madre, bailando todo se arregla. Pegate un poco más, te llamas los tambores, olvida los temores. Que el tiempo se lo va. Te mueves a saber, salta cosa buena. Que a mí me pone, come on, let me feel your heartbeat. Bring the fire, to my people. To the people in the United States. Come on, that's right, that's right. Here we go. Come on, that's right, that's right. But I can't get out in the night if that's all. Thank you, Fat Joe, and thank you, Ricky Martin. You know, they say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. But tomorrow, what happens in Vegas just might change our country forever. Because Nevada is ready to elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States of America. And Vegas is pulling out all the stops to get people to the polls, including the ultimate stop. They've activated the sphere. This baby's been lit up blue all week, reminding everyone to get out and vote. And for our next speaker, we're going to travel just down the road from the sphere to another iconic Vegas site. We know Vegas is Union strong. So let's make some noise as I pass the mic to the executive secretary treasurer of the Southern Nevada Building Trains Union, Vince Saavedra, live from the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Music Music Come on out. That's right, that's right.",chunk_5,362
